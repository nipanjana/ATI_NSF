journal = {Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society},
title = {Biased reionization and non-Gaussianity in redshifted 21-cm intensity maps of the reionization epoch},
abstract = {Spatial dependence in the statistics of redshifted 21-cm fluctuations promises to provide the most powerful probe of the reionization epoch. In this paper we consider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21-cm intensity distribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during the reionization process. We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21-cm maps should be substantial throughout the reionization epoch and on all angular scales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionization in overdense regions of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The variance (or power spectrum) of 21-cm fluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the reionization process, when the global ionization fraction is around 50 per cent. This minimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21-cm intensity being dominated by overdense to underdense regions as reionization progresses. We show that the details of the reionization history, including the presence of radiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the autocorrelation and skewness functions with redshift and mean IGM neutral fraction. The amplitudes of fluctuations are particularly sensitive to the masses of ionizing sources, and vary by an order of magnitude for astrophysically plausible models. We discuss the detection of skewness by first-generation instruments, and conclude that the Mileura Wide-field Array-Low-Frequency Demonstrator will have sufficient sensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts near the end of reionization, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times the collecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail. The observation of a minimum in variance during the reionization history, and the detection of skewness would both provide important confirmation of the cosmological origin of redshifted 21-cm intensity fluctuations.},

abstract = {Statistical observations of the epoch of reionization (EOR) power spectrum provide a rich data set for understanding the transition from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the ionized universe we see today. EOR observations have become an active area of experimental cosmology, and three first-generation observatories-MWA, PAST, and LOFAR-are currently under development. In this paper we provide the first quantitative calculation of the three-dimensional power spectrum sensitivity, incorporating the design parameters of a planned array. This calculation is then used to explore the constraints these first-generation observations can place on the EOR power spectrum. The results demonstrate the potential for upcoming power spectrum observations to constrain theories of structure formation and reionization.},

title = {Simulations and Analytic Calculations of Bubble Growth during Hydrogen Reionization},
abstract = {We present results from a large volume simulation of hydrogen reionization. We combine 3D radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation, describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the growth of H II regions around high-redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks 10243 dark matter particles, in a box of comoving side length 65.6 Mpc h-1. This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of H II regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: H II regions grow collectively around highly clustered sources and have a well-defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to R>10 Mpc toward the end. We present a detailed statistical description of our results and compare them with a numerical scheme based on the analytic model by Furlanetto and coworkers. We find that the analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of H II regions and the 21 cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small-scale structure than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm surveys and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.},

title = {21 Centimeter Fluctuations from Cosmic Gas at High Redshifts},
abstract = {The relatively large Thomson optical depth, τes, inferred recently from the WMAP observations suggests that the universe was reionized in a more complex manner than previously believed. However, the value of τes provides only an integral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be used to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition. Here we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21 cm radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both frequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations in the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution of matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects become ionized, producing large H II regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized material imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible to distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations. The variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the evolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the absolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is difficult to detect as a result of contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of noise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e., redshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a much brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency), background.},

title = {Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble: 21 cm measurements of the high-redshift universe},
abstract = {I review the potential insights to be gained from 21 cm measurements of the high-redshift universe. At the highest redshifts (z ˜ 30 150), the gas appears in absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) because collisions drive the spin temperature TS below the CMB temperature TCMB. In this epoch, 21 cm fluctuations trace the matter power spectrum and its growth history. At z < 30, collisions become inefficient and TS → TCMB. However, hot collapsed minihalos and proto-filaments in the cosmic web appear in emission, allowing us to trace the beginnings of structure formation. Once the first luminous objects appear, they flood the universe with Lyα photons. Fluctuations in the radiation field induce 21 cm fluctuations through variations in the coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures of the gas. The temperature fluctuations saturate once the radiation background becomes substantial and X-rays have efficiently heated the universe. During this reionization era the 21 cm signal traces the gas density and the ionization field. The resulting fluctuations will offer enormous insight into the nature of the sources driving reionization and their interactions with the intergalactic medium.},

Polarized emission is found to be ubiquitous with typical levels of about 3-5 K brightness temperature with a generally mottled structure. The Rotation Measure (RM) of the emission varies between values of -5 to +20 rad m-2. Most of the polarized emission appears Faraday thin with a single unresolved valued for the RM. The data suggest both inhomogeneous as well as dissimilar distribution functions of the synchrotron emitting and Faraday rotating media along the line of sight. The systematic patterns in the RM at this high Galactic latitude of +71 $\,^{\circ}$ also provide evidence for significant variations in the vertical component of the local Galactic magnetic field at a level of 1 μGauss. The potential for Galactic polarimetry at even lower frequencies using LOFAR and SKA is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Analytical approaches to galaxy formation and reionization are based on the mathematical problem of random walks with barriers. The statistics of a single random walk can be used to calculate one-point distributions ranging from the mass function of virialized haloes to the distribution of ionized bubble sizes during reionization. However, an analytical calculation of two-point correlation functions or of spatially dependent feedback processes requires the joint statistics of random walks at two different points. An accurate analytical expression for the statistics of two correlated random walks has been previously found only for the case of a constant barrier height. However, calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involves more general barriers that can often be approximated as linear barriers. We generalize the two-point solution with constant barriers to linear barriers, and apply it as an illustration to calculate the correlation function of cosmological 21-cm fluctuations during reionization.},

abstract = {Absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation may be observed in the redshifted 21 cm line if the spin temperature of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) prior to reionization differs from the CMB temperature. This so-called 21 cm tomography should reveal important information on the physical state of the IGM at high redshifts. The fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm line, due to gas density inhomogeneities at early times, should be observed at meter wavelengths by the next-generation radio telescopes such as the proposed Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Here we show that the extragalactic radio sources provide a serious contamination to the brightness temperature fluctuations expected in the redshifted 21 cm emission from the IGM at high redshifts. Unless the radio source population cuts off at flux levels above the planned sensitivity of SKA, its clustering noise component will dominate the angular fluctuations in the 21 cm signal. The integrated foreground signal is smooth in frequency space, and it should nonetheless be possible to identify the sharp spectral feature arising from the nonuniformities in the neutral hydrogen density during the epoch when the first UV sources reionize the IGM.},

title = {Higher Order Contributions to the 21 cm Power Spectrum},
abstract = {We consider the contribution of third- and fourth-order terms to the 21 cm power spectrum during the epoch of reionization, which arise because the 21 cm brightness temperature involves a product of the hydrogenic neutral fraction and the gas density. The third-order terms vanish for Gaussian random fields and have been previously neglected or ignored. We measure these terms from radiative transfer simulations and estimate them using cosmological perturbation theory. In our simulated models, the higher order terms are significant, and neglecting them leads to inaccurate 21 cm power spectrum estimates. On small scales the higher order terms are produced by gravitational mode coupling. Small-scale structure grows more readily in large-scale overdense regions, but the same regions tend to be ionized and hence do not contribute to the 21 cm signal. This modifies an earlier intuition that the 21 cm power spectrum simply traces the density power spectrum on scales smaller than that of a typical bubble and implies that small-scale measurements contain more information about the ionizing sources than previously believed. On large scales, higher order moments are not directly related to gravity. They are nonzero because overdense regions tend to ionize first and are important in magnitude at late times, due to large fluctuations in the neutral fraction. Finally, we show that second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory approximately reproduces the statistics of the density field from full numerical simulations for all redshifts and scales of interest, including the mode-coupling effects mentioned above. It can, therefore, be used in conjunction with semianalytic models to explore the broad regions of parameter space relevant for future 21 cm surveys.},

title = {Toward Epoch of Reionization Measurements with Wide-Field Radio Observations},
abstract = {This paper explores the potential for statistical epoch of reionization (EOR) measurements using wide-field radio observations. New developments in low-frequency radio instrumentation and signal processing allow very sensitive EOR measurements, and the analysis techniques enabled by these advances offer natural ways of separating the EOR signal from the residual foreground emission. This paper introduces the enabling technologies and proposes an analysis technique designed to make optimal use of the capabilities of next-generation low-frequency radio arrays. The observations we propose can directly observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations and are significantly more sensitive than other techniques that have been discussed in the literature. For example, in the absence of foreground contamination the measurements we propose would produce five 3 σ power spectrum points in 100 hr of observation with only 4 MHz bandwidth with LOFAR for simple models of the high-redshift 21 cm emission. The challenge of residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the three-dimensional (two spatial frequencies and radio frequency) radio interferometric data. These symmetries naturally separate the EOR signal from most classes of residual unsubtracted foreground contamination, including all foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.},

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations of reionization to predict the possible signal from the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the pre-reionization era and to investigate the observability of this signal. We show that the separation of the mean (global) signal over the whole sky from the known foreground contamination may be feasible but very challenging. In agreement with previous studies, we demonstrate that measuring angular fluctuations in the H I signal is likely to be extremely difficult if not impossible because of the overwhelming contamination from the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. However, we show that the sharp H I fluctuations in the frequency domain should be easily separable from the relatively smooth spectra of the foregrounds and that these fluctuations should be detectable even at moderate angular resolution (~10'-20').},

title = {Lensing Reconstruction Using Redshifted 21 Centimeter Fluctuations},
abstract = {We investigate the potential of second generation measurements of redshifted 21 cm radiation from before and during the epoch of reionization (EOR) to reconstruct the matter density fluctuations along the line of sight. To do so we generalize the quadratic methods developed for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to 21 cm fluctuations. We show that the three-dimensional signal can be decomposed into a finite number of line-of-sight Fourier modes that contribute to the lensing reconstruction. Our formalism properly takes into account correlations along the line of sight and uses all the information contained in quadratic combinations of the signal. In comparison with the CMB, 21 cm fluctuations have the disadvantage of a relatively scale invariant unlensed power spectrum, which suppresses the lensing effect. The smallness of the lensing effect is compensated by using information from a range of observed redshifts. We estimate the size of experiments that are needed to measure this effect. With a square kilometer of collecting area and a maximal baseline of 3 km, one can achieve lensing reconstruction noise levels an order of magnitude below CMB quadratic estimator constraints at L=1000, and map the deflection field out to less then a tenth of a degree (L>2000) within a season of observations on one field. Statistical lensing power spectrum detections will be possible to subarcminute scales, even with the limited sky coverage that currently conceived experiments have. One should be able to improve constraints on cosmological parameters by using this method. With larger collecting areas or longer observing times, one could probe arcminute scales of the lensing potential and thus individual clusters. We address the effect that foregrounds might have on lensing reconstruction with 21 cm fluctuations.},

title = {LOFAR - Opening up a new window on the Universe},
abstract = {LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array, is a next-generation radio telescope that is being built in Northern Europe and expected to be fully operational at the end of this decade. It will operate at frequencies from 15 to 240 MHz (corresponding to wavelengths of 20 to 1.2 m). Its superb sensitivity, high angular resolution, large field of view and flexible spectroscopic capabilities will represent a dramatic improvement over previous facilities at these wavelengths. As such, LOFAR will carry out a broad range of fundamental astrophysical studies. The design of LOFAR has been driven by four fundamental astrophysical applications: (i) The Epoch of Reionisation, (ii) Extragalactic Surveys and their exploitation to study the formation and evolution of clusters, galaxies and black holes, (iii) Transient Sources and their association with high energy objects such as gamma ray bursts, and (iv) Cosmic Ray showers and their exploitation to study the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this conference the foreseen LOFAR work on the epoch of reionisation has been covered by de Bruyn and on cosmic ray showers by Falcke. During this contribution we will first present the LOFAR project with an emphasis on the challenges faced when carrying out sensitive imaging at low radio frequencies. Subsequently, we will discuss LOFAR's capabilities to survey the low-frequency radio sky. Main aims for the planned surveys are studies of z>6 radio galaxies, diffuse emission associated with distant clusters and starbursting galaxies at z>2.},

abstract = {The present-day Universe is seemingly dominated by dark energy and dark matter, but mapping the normal (baryonic) content remains vital for both astrophysics understanding how galaxies form and astro-particle physics inferring properties of the dark components. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will provide the only means of studying the cosmic evolution of neutral hydrogen (HI) which, alongside information on star formation from the radio continuum, is needed to understand how stars formed from gas within dark-matter over-densities and the r{\^o}les of gas accretion and galaxy merging. `All hemisphere' HI redshift surveys to z ˜ 1.5 are feasible with wide-field-of-view realizations of the SKA and, by measuring the galaxy power spectrum in exquisite detail, will allow the first precise studies of the equation-of-state of dark energy. The SKA will be capable of other uniquely powerful cosmological studies including the measurement of the dark-matter power spectrum using weak gravitational lensing, and the precise measurement of H0 using extragalactic water masers. The SKA is likely to become the premier dark-energy-measuring machine, bringing breakthroughs in cosmology beyond those likely to be made possible by combining CMB (e.g. Planck), optical (e.g. LSST, SNAP) and other early-21st-century datasets.},

title = {Configuration Considerations for Low Frequency Arrays},
abstract = {The advance of digital signal processing capabilities has spurred a new effort to exploit the lowest radio frequencies observable from the ground, from ˜10 MHz to a few hundred MHz. Multiple scientifically and technically complementary instruments are planned, including the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) in the 80-300 MHz range, and the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) in the 20-80 MHz range. The latter instrument will target relatively high angular resolution, and baselines up to a few hundred km. An important practical question for the design of such an array is how to distribute the collecting area on the ground. The answer to this question profoundly affects both cost and performance. In this contribution, the factors which determine the anticipated performance of any such array are examined, paying particular attention to the viability and accuracy of array calibration. It is argued that due to the severity of ionospheric effects in particular, it will be difficult or impossible to achieve routine, high dynamic range imaging with a geographically large low frequency array, unless a large number of physically separate array stations is built. This conclusion is general, is based on the need for adequate sampling of ionospheric irregularities, and is independent of the calibration algorithms and techniques that might be employed. It is further argued that array configuration figures of merit that are traditionally used for higher frequency arrays are inappropriate, and a different set of criteria are proposed.},

abstract = {An 8 X 8 equals 64 element digital interferometer was developed at Waseda University (1989 - 1995). It was an equally spaced two dimensional array of 2.4 m dishes at 10.6 GHz, and a 2D FFT processor was used for Nyquist rate imaging. Recently a spatial-temporal (2 + 1)D FFT processor has been developed for pulsar survey (1996 - 2000), in which a first 2D spatial FFT transforms the electric fields of coordinate represented to those of momentum represented. We obtain the electric fields in each 64 direction at Nyquist rate by the 2D spatial Fourier transform. The following temporal 1D FFT gives the spectrum of 64ch or 256ch to 64 directions respectively also at Nyquist rate. The total bandwidths of each direction are 20 MHz and the resulting frequency resolutions are 20/64 MHz or 20/256 MHz. For sensitive pulsar survey, we also have developed an interferometric array of 20 m spherical dishes in Nasu flat, 160 km north of Tokyo. Five dishes are completed at present. Normal temperature receivers of high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) are used at 1.4 GHz observation and the receiver noise temperatures are below 40 K. Expected rms detection limit (Delta) T is about 10-2K under the condition of 20 MHz band widths and 1s integration time. Preliminary results of zenith survey at (delta) equals 40 deg using a single dish show (Delta) T equals 0.03 K without switching. Sub-reflectors and feed horns were designed so as to observe 5 deg off directions from zenith and they rotate around Az axis. It enable us to survey the declination zone of 32 <EQ (delta) <EQ 42 deg.},

abstract = {Next generation radio observatories such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the Combined Array for Research Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) provide a number of challenges for interferometric data analysis. These challenges include heterogeneous arrays, direction-dependent instrumental gain, and refractive and scintillating atmospheric conditions. From the analysis perspective, this means that calibration solutions cannot be described using a single complex gain per antenna. In this paper, we use the optimal map-making formalism developed for cosmic microwave background analyses to extend traditional interferometric radio analysis techniques - removing the assumption of a single complex gain per antenna and allowing more complete descriptions of the instrumental and atmospheric conditions. Due to the similarity with holographic mapping of radio antenna surfaces, we call this extended analysis approach software holography. The resulting analysis algorithms are computationally efficient, unbiased and optimally sensitive. We show how software holography can be used to solve some of the challenges of next generation observations, and how more familiar analysis techniques can be derived as limiting cases.},

title = {The effect of Galactic foreground subtraction on redshifted 21-cm observations of quasar HII regions},
abstract = {We assess the impact of Galactic synchrotron foreground removal on the observation of high-redshift quasar HII regions in redshifted 21-cm emission. We consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium (IGM) whose ionization structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing time of the HII region, as well as the case where the evolution is rapid. The latter case is expected towards the end of the reionization era where the highest redshift luminous quasars will be observed. In the absence of foregrounds, the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM could be measured directly from the contrast between the HII region and surrounding IGM. However, we find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the HII region and the IGM. This indicates that measurement of the neutral fraction would require modelling to correct for this systematic effect. On the other hand, foreground removal does not modify the most prominent features of the 21-cm maps. Using a simple algorithm, we demonstrate that measurements of the size and shape of observed HII regions will not be affected by continuum foreground removal. Moreover, measurements of these quantities will not be adversely affected by the presence of a rapidly evolving IGM.},

title = {The observed ionization rate of the intergalactic medium and the ionizing emissivity at z >= 5: evidence for a photon-starved and extended epoch of reionization},
abstract = {Galaxies and quasars are thought to provide the bulk of the photons responsible for ionizing the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use a large set of hydrodynamical simulations, combined with measurements of the Lyα opacity of the IGM taken from the literature, to obtain robust estimates of the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom at z = 5 and 6. We find the photoionization rate drops by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively, compared to our recent measurements at z = 2-4. The number of ionizing photons emitted by known sources at z = 5 and 6, based on an extrapolation of source numbers below the detection limit and standard assumptions for the relationship between the ionizing emissivity and observed luminosity density at 1500 {\AA}, are in reasonable agreement with the photoionization rates inferred from the Lyα forest if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is large (>~20 per cent). The expected number of ionizing photons from observed sources at these redshifts therefore appears sufficient to maintain the IGM in its highly ionized state. Claims to the contrary may be attributed to the adoption of an unduly high value for the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen. Using physically motivated assumptions for the mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionization rate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. In comoving units the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshift range 2-6 and corresponds to 1.5-3 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over a time interval corresponding to the age of the Universe at z = 6. This strongly suggests that the epoch of reionization was photon-starved and extended. Completion of reionization at or before z = 6 requires either an emissivity which rises towards higher redshifts or one which remains constant but is dominated by sources with a rather hard spectral index. For standard assumptions, the ionizing emissivity required for completion of reionization at or before z = 6 lies at the upper end of recently reported values from searches for high-redshift galaxies at z = 8-10.},

We describe a suite of general algorithms which apply to any bispectrum which can be represented in factorizable form. First, we present algorithms for Fisher matrix forecasts and the related problem of optimizing the factorizable representation, giving a Fisher forecast for Planck as an example. We show that the CMB can give independent constraints on the amplitude of primordial bispectra of both local and equilateral shape as well as those created by secondary anisotropies. We also show that the ISW-lensing bispectrum should be detected by Planck and could bias estimates of the local type of non-Gaussianity if not properly accounted for. Second, we implement a bispectrum estimator which is fully optimal in the presence of sky cuts and inhomogeneous noise, extends the generality of fast estimators which have been limited to a few specific forms of the bispectrum, and improves the running time of existing implementations by several orders of magnitude. Third, we give an algorithm for simulating random, weakly non-Gaussian maps with prescribed power spectrum and factorizable bispectrum.},

title = {Constraining the topology of reionization through Lyα absorption},
abstract = {The reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is a crucial landmark in the history of the Universe, but the processes through which it occurs remain mysterious. In particular, recent numerical and analytic work suggest that reionization by stellar sources is driven by large-scale density fluctuations and must be inhomogeneous on scales of many comoving Mpc. We examine the prospects for constraining the topology of neutral and ionized gas through Lyα absorption of high-redshift sources. One method is to search for gaps in the Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs of luminous sources. These could occur if the line of sight passes sufficiently close to the centre of a large HII region. In contrast to previous work, we find a non-negligible (though still small) probability of observing such a gap before reionization is complete. In our model the transmission spike at z= 6.08 in the spectrum of SDSS J1148+5251 does not necessarily require overlap to have been completed at an earlier epoch. We also examine the IGM damping wing absorption of the Lyα emission lines of star-forming galaxies. Because most galaxies sit inside of large HII regions, we find that the severity of absorption is significantly smaller than previously thought and decoupled from the properties of the observed galaxy. While this limits our ability to constrain the mean neutral fraction of the IGM from observations of individual galaxies, it presents the exciting possibility of measuring the size distribution and evolution of the ionized bubbles by examining the distribution of damping wing optical depths in a large sample of galaxies.},

abstract = {In preparation for the full Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA extragalactic HI survey, precursor observations were carried out in Aug-Sep 2004 with the 7-beam Arecibo L-band feed array (ALFA) receiver system and the WAPP spectral processors. While these observations were geared mainly at testing and debugging survey strategy, hardware and software, approximately 36 hours of telescope time yielded science-quality data. From those observations, an initial list of 730 tentative detections of varying degree of reliability was extracted. Ninety-eight high signal-to-noise candidates were deemed to be bona fide HI line detections. To test our ability to discriminate cosmic signals from RFI and noise, 165 candidates ranging in reliability likelihood were re-observed with the single beam L-band wide system at Arecibo in Jan-Feb 2005. Of those, 41% were confirmed as real. We present the results of both the ALFA and single beam observations for the sample of 166 confirmed HI sources, as well as our assessment of their optical counterparts. Of the 166 sources, 62 coincide with previously known HI sources, while optical redshifts were available for an additional 18 galaxies; thus, 52% of the redshifts reported here were previously unknown. Of the 166 HI detections, 115 are identified with previously cataloged galaxies, of either known or unknown redshift, leaving 51 objects identified for the first time. Because of the higher sensitivity of the Arecibo system, fewer than 10% of the 166 HI sources would have been detected by a HIPASS-like survey of the same region. Three of the objects have HI masses less than 10^7 solar masses. The full ALFALFA survey which commenced in February 2005 should detect more than 100 times as many objects of similarly low HI mass over the next 5 years.},

title = {Constraining Reionization Using 21 cm Observations in Combination with CMB and Lyman-alpha Forest Data},
abstract = {In this poster, we explore the constraints on the reionization history that are provided by current observations of the Lyman-alpha forest and the CMB. Rather than using a particular semi-analytic model, we take the novel approach of parametrizing the ionizing sources with arbitrary functions, and perform likelihood analyses to constrain possible reionization histories. We find model independent conclusions that reionization is likely to be mostly complete by z=8 and that the IGM was 50% ionized at z=9-10. Upcoming low-frequency observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen are expected to place significantly better constraints on the hydrogen neutral fraction at 6<z<12. We use our constraints on the reionization history to predict the likely amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum and show that observations with the highest signal-to-noise ratio will most likely be made at frequencies corresponding to z=9-10. This result provides an important guide to the upcoming 21 cm observations. Finally, we assess the impact that measurement of the neutral fraction will have on our knowledge of reionization and the early source population. Our results show that a single measurement of the neutral fraction mid-way through the reionization era will significantly enhance our knowledge of the entire reionization history.

title = {Evolution of the 21cm signal throughout cosmic history},
abstract = {The potential use of the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen for probing the epoch of reionization is motivating the construction of several low-frequency interferometers. There is also much interest in the possibility of constraining the initial conditions from inflation and the nature of the dark matter and dark energy by probing the power spectrum of density perturbations in three dimensions and on smaller scales than probed by the microwave background anisotropies. Theoretical understanding of the 21 cm signal has been fragmented into different regimes of physical interest. In this paper, we make the first attempt to describe the full redshift evolution of the 21 cm signal between 0<z<300. We include contributions to the 21 cm signal from fluctuations in the gas density, temperature, and neutral fraction, as well as the Lyα flux, and allow for a post-reionization signal from damped Lyα systems. Our comprehensive analysis provides a useful foundation for optimizing the design of future arrays whose goal is to separate the particle physics from the astrophysics, either by probing the peculiar velocity distortion of the 21 cm power spectrum, or by extending the 21 cm horizon to z≳25 before the first galaxies had formed, or to z≲6 when the residual pockets of hydrogen trace large-scale structure.},

To aid experimental planning and design, we quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We cover assumptions related to modeling of the ionization power spectrum and associated nonlinearity, experimental specifications like array layout and noise, cosmological assumptions about reionization history and inter-galactic medium (IGM) evolution, and assumptions about astrophysical foregrounds. We derive simple analytic approximations for how various assumptions affect the results, and find that ionization power modeling is most important, followed by array layout (crudely, the more compact, the better). We also present an accurate yet robust method for measuring cosmological parameters in practice, separating the physics from the astrophysics by exploiting both gravitationally induced clustering anisotropy and the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. For example, a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could improve the sensitivity of the Planck CMB satellite to spatial curvature and neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002 and Delta m_nu ~ 0.007 eV, and give a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index running predicted by the simpliest inflation models.},

title = {Fast large-scale reionization simulations},
abstract = {We present an efficient method to generate large simulations of the epoch of reionization without the need for a full three-dimensional radiative transfer code. Large dark-matter-only simulations are post-processed to produce maps of the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen. Dark matter haloes are embedded with sources of radiation whose properties are either based on semi-analytical prescriptions or derived from hydrodynamical simulations. These sources could either be stars or power-law sources with varying spectral indices. Assuming spherical symmetry, ionized bubbles are created around these sources, whose radial ionized fraction and temperature profiles are derived from a catalogue of one-dimensional radiative transfer experiments. In case of overlap of these spheres, photons are conserved by redistributing them around the connected ionized regions corresponding to the spheres. The efficiency with which these maps are created allows us to span the large parameter space typically encountered in reionization simulations. We compare our results with other, more accurate, three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations and find excellent agreement for the redshifts and the spatial scales of interest to upcoming 21-cm experiments. We generate a contiguous observational cube spanning redshift 6 to 12 and use these simulations to study the differences in the reionization histories between stars and quasars. Finally, the signal is convolved with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) beam response and its effects are analysed and quantified. Statistics performed on this mock data set shed light on possible observational strategies for LOFAR.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness from cosmic hydrogen at redshifts z>~6 have their source in the primordial density perturbations from inflation, as well as the radiation from galaxies. We propose a method to separate these components based on the angular dependence of the 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum. Peculiar velocities increase the power spectrum by a factor of ~2 compared with density fluctuations alone and introduce an angular dependence in Fourier space. The resulting angular structure relative to the line of sight facilitates a simple separation of the power spectrum into several components, permitting an unambiguous determination of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations, and of the detailed properties of all astrophysical sources of 21 cm fluctuations. We also demonstrate that angular multipoles are not useful for measuring large-scale power, and thus, theoretical predictions should focus on the three-dimensional power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations.},

title = {Foreground simulations for the LOFAR-epoch of reionization experiment},
abstract = {Future high-redshift 21-cm experiments will suffer from a high degree of contamination, due both to astrophysical foregrounds and to non-astrophysical and instrumental effects. In order to reliably extract the cosmological signal from the observed data, it is essential to understand very well all data components and their influence on the extracted signal. Here we present simulated astrophysical foregrounds data cubes and discuss their possible statistical effects on the data. The foreground maps are produced assuming 5$\,^{\circ}$ × 5$\,^{\circ}$ windows that match those expected to be observed by the LOFAR epoch of reionization (EoR) key science project. We show that with the expected LOFAR-EoR sky and receiver noise levels, which amount to ~52mK at 150 MHz after 400 h of total observing time, a simple polynomial fit allows a statistical reconstruction of the signal. We also show that the polynomial fitting will work for maps with realistic yet idealized instrument response, i.e. a response that includes only a uniform uv coverage as a function of frequency and ignores many other uncertainties. Polarized Galactic synchrotron maps that include internal polarization and a number of Faraday screens along the line of sight are also simulated. The importance of these stems from the fact that the LOFAR instrument, in common with all current interferometric EoR experiments, has an instrumentally polarized response.},

abstract = {21-cm tomography is emerging as a promising probe of the cosmological dark ages and the epoch of reionization, as well as a tool for observational cosmology in general. However, serious sources of foreground contamination must be subtracted for experimental efforts to be viable. In this paper, we focus on the removal of unresolved extragalactic point sources with smooth spectra, and evaluate how the residual foreground contamination after cleaning depends on instrumental and algorithmic parameters. A crucial but often ignored complication is that the synthesized beam of an interferometer array shrinks towards higher frequency, causing complicated frequency structure in each sky pixel as `frizz' far from the beam centre contracts across unresolved radio sources. We find that current-generation experiments should none the less be able to clean out this point source contamination adequately, and quantify the instrumental and algorithmic design specifications required to meet this foreground challenge.},

abstract = {We assess the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on detection of HII regions surrounding luminous high-redshift quasars using planned low-frequency radio telescopes. Our approach is to implement a seminumerical scheme to calculate the three-dimensional structure of ionized regions surrounding a massive halo at high redshift, including the ionizing influence of a luminous quasar. As part of our analysis we briefly contrast our scheme with published seminumerical models. We calculate mock 21-cm spectra along the line of sight towards high-redshift quasars, and estimate the ability of the planned Murchison Widefield Array to detect the presence of HII regions. The signal-to-noise ratio for detection will drop as the characteristic bubble size grows during reionization because the quasar's influence becomes less prominent. However, quasars will imprint a detectable signature on observed 21-cm spectra that is distinct from a region of typical intergalactic medium (IGM). At epochs where the mean hydrogen neutral fraction is ~30 per cent or greater we find that neutral gas in the IGM surrounding a single quasar will be detectable (at a significance of 5σ) within 100-h integrations in more than 50 per cent of cases. 1000-h integrations will be required to detect a smaller neutral fraction of 15 per cent in more than 50 per cent of cases. A highly significant detection will be possible in only 100 h for a stack of 10 smaller 3 proper Mpc HII regions. The accurate measurement of the global average neutral fraction (<xHI>) will be limited by systematic fluctuations between lines of sight for single HII regions. We estimate the accuracy with which the global neutral fraction could be measured from a single HII region to be 50, 30 and 20 per cent for <xHI> ~ 0.15, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively.},

Previously, cosmic magnification measurements have been seriously complicated by galaxy clustering. With precise redshifts obtained using the 21-cm emission line wavelength, one can correlate galaxies at different source planes, or exclude close pairs to eliminate such contamination. We provide forecasts for future surveys, specifically the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the Canadian Large Adaptive Reflector (CLAR). SKA can achieve ~1 per cent precision on the dark-matter power spectrum and the galaxy dark-matter cross-correlation power spectrum, while CLAR can measure an accurate cross-correlation power spectrum. The neutral hydrogen fraction was most likely significantly higher at high redshifts, which increases the number of observed galaxies significantly, such that CLAR can also measure the dark-matter lensing power spectrum. SKA can also allow precise measurement of bispectrum lensing.},

We employ an analytic model of reionization devised by Furlanetto and coworkers to calculate the kSZ anisotropies for patchy reionization. We find that the angular power spectrum of the kSZ anisotropies depends strongly on the size distribution of the HII bubbles and on the duration of reionization. In addition, we show that upcoming measurements of the kSZ effect should be able to distinguish between several popular reionization scenarios. In particular, the amplitude of the patchy power spectrum for reionization scenarios in which the IGM is significantly ionized by Population III stars (or by mini-quasars/decaying particles) can be larger (or smaller) by over a factor of 3 than the amplitude in more traditional reionization histories (with temperature anisotropies that range between 0.5 and 3 μK at l = 5000).},

title = {Eavesdropping on radio broadcasts from galactic civilizations with upcoming observatories for redshifted 21 cm radiation},
abstract = {The question of whether intelligent life exists elsewhere is one of the fundamental unknowns about our Universe. Over the past decade {\gtrsim } 200 extra-solar planets have been discovered, providing new urgency for addressing this question in these or other planetary systems. Independently of this perspective, new radio observatories for cosmology are currently being constructed with the goal of detecting 21 cm emission from cosmic hydrogen in the redshift range 6\lesssim z\lesssim 15 . The radio frequency band covered by these experiments overlaps with the range of frequencies used for telecommunication on Earth, a regime that was never explored with high sensitivity before. For example, the low-frequency demonstrator (LFD) of the Mileura Wide-Field Array (MWA), will cover in 8 kHz bins the entire frequency range of 80 300 MHz, which is perfectly matched to the band over which our civilization emits most of its radio power. We show that this and other low-frequency observatories (culminating with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)) will be able to detect radio broadcast leakage from an Earth-like civilization out to a distance of ~101-2.7 pc, within a spherical volume containing 10(3-8) × (Ωb/4π)α stars, where α = 1 (or 1.5) for a radar beam of solid angle Ωb that remains steady (or sweeps) across the sky. Such a radio signal will show up as a series of narrow spectral lines that do not coincide with known atomic or molecular lines. The high spectral resolution attainable with the upcoming observatories will allow us to monitor the periodic Doppler shift of the broadcast lines over the planet's orbital period around the parent star. Determination of the parent star mass through observations of its spectrum could then be used to infer the inclination, semi-major axis and eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This, in turn, will allow us to estimate the temperature on the planet's surface and to assess whether it can support liquid water or life as we know it.},

We present structure function (SF) analysis of the RM structure in a 28 square degree region around (l,b)=(329$\,^{\circ}$,1.5$\,^{\circ}$), which reveals an anisotropy in the structure on large scales while the SF is very shallow on smaller scales. Similar behavior is seen in Hα emission. The anisotropy is most readily explained by a large-scale gradient or filament, while the SF slope may indicate a typical outer scale of structure of ˜ 1 pc in the local spiral arm.},

abstract = {We study the observability of the reionization epoch through the 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. We use a high-resolution cosmological simulation (including hydrodynamics) together with a fast radiative transfer algorithm to compute the evolution of 21-cm emission from the intergalactic medium (IGM) in several different models of reionization. We show that the mean brightness temperature of the IGM drops from δTb~ 25 mK to ~10-2 mK during overlap (over a frequency interval Δν~ 25 MHz), while the root mean square fluctuations on small scales drop abruptly from <δT2b>1/2~ 10 mK to ~10-1 mK at the end of overlap. We show that 21-cm observations can efficiently discriminate models with a single early reionization epoch from models with two distinct reionization episodes.},

title = {Relaxing the isoplanatism assumption in self-calibration; applications to low-frequency radio interferometry},
abstract = {A fundamental assumption of the self-calibration/hybrid mapping techniques, which are in widespread use in aperture synthesis data reduction, is one of isoplanatism: that over any given element of the array, all incident wave fronts, regardless of their directions of arrival, are subject to the same tropospheric/ionospheric path delays. This a poor assumption in the case of a low-frequency array (operating at frequencies lower than approximately 300 MHz), because of the large field of view of such an instrument and because of the wavelength dependence of wave-front perturbation by the ionosphere. The isoplanatism assumption may be relaxed by incorporating an interpolation formula in the solution for antenna/IF phases, and the usual mapping/deconvolution techniques then must be modified in order to cope with space-variant effects. Because of the consequent increase in the number of solution parameters, a better source model, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a larger number of array elements (than are ordinarily required in order to self-calibrate) become desirable.},

title = {The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey. I. Science Goals, Survey Design, and Strategy},
abstract = {The recently initiated Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey aims to map ~7000 deg2 of the high Galactic latitude sky visible from Arecibo, providing a H I line spectral database covering the redshift range between -1600 and 18,000 km s-1 with ~5 km s-1 resolution. Exploiting Arecibo's large collecting area and small beam size, ALFALFA is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the H I mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of H I in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits, making it especially useful in synergy with wide-area surveys conducted at other wavelengths. ALFALFA will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the Local Supercluster and nearby superclusters, allow measurement of the H I diameter function, and enable a first wide-area blind search for local H I tidal features, H I absorbers at z<0.06, and OH megamasers in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.25. Although completion of the survey will require some 5 years, public access to the ALFALFA data and data products will be provided in a timely manner, thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the ALFALFA collaboration. ALFALFA adopts a two-pass, minimum intrusion, drift scan observing technique that samples the same region of sky at two separate epochs to aid in the discrimination of cosmic signals from noise and terrestrial interference. Survey simulations, which take into account large-scale structure in the mass distribution and incorporate experience with the ALFA system gained from tests conducted during its commissioning phase, suggest that ALFALFA will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic H I line sources out to z~0.06, including several hundred with H I masses MHI<107.5 Msolar.},

title = {Quasar Proximity Zones and Patchy Reionization},
abstract = {Lyα forest absorption spectra toward quasars at z~6 show regions of enhanced transmission close to their source. Several authors have argued that the apparently small sizes of these regions indicate that quasar ionization fronts at z>~6 expand into a largely or partly neutral IGM. Assuming that the typical region in the IGM is reionized by z<=6, as is suggested by Lyα forest observations, we argue that at least 50% of the volume of the IGM was reionized before the highest redshift quasars turned on. Further, even if the IGM is as much as ~50% neutral at quasar turn-on, the quasars are likely born into large galaxy-generated H II regions. The H II regions during reionization are themselves clustered, and using radiative transfer simulations, we find that long skewers through the IGM toward quasar progenitor halos pass entirely through ionized bubbles, even when the IGM is half-neutral. These effects have been neglected in most previous analyses of quasar proximity zones, which assumed a spatially uniform neutral fraction. We model the subsequent ionization from a quasar and construct mock Lyα forest spectra. Our mock absorption spectra are more sensitive to the level of small-scale structure in the IGM than to the volume-averaged neutral fraction and suggest that existing proximity zone size measurements are compatible with a fully ionized IGM. However, we mention several improvements in our modeling that are necessary to make more definitive conclusions.},

abstract = {We reconsider the Alcock-Paczy{\'n}ski effect on 21-cm fluctuations from high redshift, focusing on the 21-cm power spectrum. We show that at each accessible redshift both the angular diameter distance and the Hubble constant can be determined from the power spectrum, at epochs and on scales where the ionized fraction fluctuations are linear. Furthermore, this is possible using anisotropies that depend only on linear density perturbations and not on astrophysical sources of 21-cm fluctuations. We show that measuring these quantities at high redshift would not just confirm results from the cosmic microwave background (CMB); if the 21-cm power spectrum can be measured to better than 10 per cent precision, it will improve constraints from the CMB alone on cosmological parameters including dark energy.},

We improve on previous "optimal" quadratic lensing estimators by using shear and convergence instead of deflection angles. We find that non-Gaussianity provides a limit to the accuracy of weak lensing reconstruction, even if instrumental noise is reduced to zero. The best reconstruction result is equivalent to Gaussian sources with effectively independent cell of side length 2.0/h Mpc. Using a source full map from z=10-20, this limiting sensitivity allows mapping of dark matter at a Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) greater than 1 out to l < 6000, which is better than any other proposed technique for large area weak lensing mapping.},

Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z ⩾ 6. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will provide critical insight into the EoR, in a number of ways. First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21-cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization, and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21-cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral `cosmic web', as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM.},

title = {Probing the First Sources with the Redshifted 21 cm Line},
abstract = {Observations of the redshifted 21 cm line offer a promising probe of early radiation backgrounds. Anisotropies in the 21 cm signal arise from fluctuations in the IGM temperature, density, and neutral fraction and through the Lyman alpha flux. These fluctuations contain a wealth of information on the background radiation field at UV and X-ray frequencies. Before reionization, spatial variation in the Lyman alpha flux from the first sources imprints information about the source distribution on the 21 cm signal. Later, as the IGM is heated by X-rays, inhomogeneous heating leads to gas temperature fluctuations whose detection could constrain the luminosity and spectrum of the first X-ray sources. In this talk, I will discuss theoretical models for both of these mechanisms and outline the possiblities for detection with future experiments. I will also comment on the effect of these sources on galaxy formation. This work was supported at Caltech in part by DoE DE-FG0392-ER40701.},

title = {A generalized measurement equation and van Cittert-Zernike theorem for wide-field radio astronomical interferometry},
abstract = {We derive a generalized van Cittert-Zernike (vC-Z) theorem for radio astronomy that is valid for partially polarized sources over an arbitrarily wide field of view (FoV). The classical vC-Z theorem is the theoretical foundation of radio astronomical interferometry, and its application is the basis of interferometric imaging. Existing generalized vC-Z theorems in radio astronomy assume, however, either paraxiality (narrow FoV) or scalar (unpolarized) sources. Our theorem uses neither of these assumptions, which are seldom fulfiled in practice in radio astronomy, and treats the full electromagnetic field. To handle wide, partially polarized fields, we extend the two-dimensional (2D) electric field (Jones vector) formalism of the standard `Measurement Equation' (ME) of radio astronomical interferometry to the full three-dimensional (3D) formalism developed in optical coherence theory. The resulting vC-Z theorem enables full-sky imaging in a single telescope pointing, and imaging based not only on standard dual-polarized interferometers (that measure 2D electric fields) but also electric tripoles and electromagnetic vector-sensor interferometers. We show that the standard 2D ME is easily obtained from our formalism in the case of dual-polarized antenna element interferometers. We also exploit an extended 2D ME to determine that dual-polarized interferometers can have polarimetric aberrations at the edges of a wide FoV. Our vC-Z theorem is particularly relevant to proposed, and recently developed, wide FoV interferometers such as Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Square Kilometer Array (SKA), for which direction-dependent effects will be important.},

title = {Fossil Ionized Bubbles Around Dead Quasars During Reionization},
abstract = {One of the most dramatic signatures of the reionization era may be the enormous ionized bubbles around luminous quasars (with radii reaching ~40 comoving Mpc), which may survive as "fossil'' ionized regions long after their source shuts off. Here we study how the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM) evolves inside such fossils. The average recombination rate declines rapidly with time, and the brief quasar episode significantly increases the mean free path inside the fossil bubbles. As a result, even a weak ionizing background generated by galaxies inside the fossil can maintain it in a relatively highly and uniformly ionized state. For example, galaxies that would ionize 20-30% of hydrogen in a random patch of the IGM can maintain 80-90% ionization inside the fossil, for a duration much longer than the average recombination time in the IGM. Quasar fossils at z<10 thus retain their identity for nearly a Hubble time, and will appear "gray,'' distinct from both the average IGM (which has a "swiss-cheese" ionization topology and a lower mean ionized fraction), and from fully-ionized bubbles around active quasars. More distant fossils, at z>10 have a weaker galaxy-generated ionizing background and a higher gas density, so they can attain a swiss-cheese topology similar to the rest of the IGM, but with a smaller contrast between the ionized bubbles and the partially neutral regions separating them. Analogous HeIII-fossils should exist around the epoch of HeII/HeIII reionization at z~3, although rapid recombinations inside the HeIII-fossils will be more common. Our model of inhomogeneous recombination also applies to "double reionization'' models and shows that a non-monotonic reionization history is even more unlikely than previously thought.},

title = {The impact of HI in galaxies on 21-cm intensity fluctuations during the reionization epoch},
abstract = {We investigate the impact of neutral hydrogen (HI) in galaxies on the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations using seminumerical modelling. Following the reionization of hydrogen, the HI content of the Universe is dominated by damped absorption systems (DLAs), with a cosmic density in HI that is observed to be constant at a level equal to ~2 per cent of the cosmic baryon density from z ~ 1 to z ~ 5. We show that extrapolation of this constant fraction into the reionization epoch results in a reduction in the amplitude of 21-cm fluctuations over a range of spatial scales. We further find that consideration of HI in galaxies/DLAs reduces the prominence of the HII region induced shoulder in the 21-cm power spectrum (PS), and hence modifies the scale dependence of 21-cm fluctuations. We also estimate the 21-cm-galaxy cross PS and show that the cross PS changes sign on scales corresponding to the HII regions. From consideration of the sensitivity for forthcoming low-frequency arrays, we find that the effects of HI in galaxies/DLAs on the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations will be significant with respect to the precision of a PS or cross PS measurement. In addition, since overdense regions are reionized first we demonstrate that the cross-correlation between galaxies and 21-cm emission changes sign at the end of the reionization era, providing an alternative avenue to pinpoint the end of reionization. The sum of our analysis indicates that the HI content of the galaxies that reionize the universe will need to be considered in detailed modelling of the 21-cm intensity PS in order to correctly interpret measurements from forthcoming low-frequency arrays.},

The gridded aperture-plane estimators are also used to construct Wiener-filtered images using the signal and noise covariance matrices used in the likelihood analysis. Results are shown for simulated data.

title = {Detecting the Rise and Fall of 21 cm Fluctuations with the Murchison Widefield Array},
abstract = {We forecast the sensitivity with which the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can measure the 21 cm power spectrum of cosmic hydrogen. The MWA is sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of k~0.1-1 h Mpc-1). This amounts primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift evolution in these quantities can yield important information about reionization. We examine a range of theoretical models, spanning uncertainties in the nature of the ionizing sources and the abundance of minihalos during reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially among these models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales (k~0.4 h Mpc-1) peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is ~50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum flattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the H II regions grow. With regards to detection sensitivity, we show that the optimal MWA antenna configuration for power spectrum measurements would pack all 500 antenna tiles as closely as possible in a compact core. Detecting the characteristic redshift evolution of our models will help to confirm that observed 21 cm fluctuations originate from the IGM, and not from foregrounds, and will provide an indirect constraint on the evolution of the volume-filling factor of H II regions during reionization. After two years of observations, the MWA can constrain the filling factor at an epoch when i>~0.5 to within roughly +/-δi>~0.1 at 2 σ confidence.},

abstract = {Many models of early structure formation predict a period of heating immediately preceding reionization, when X-rays raise the gas temperature above that of the cosmic microwave background. These X-rays are often assumed to heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) uniformly, but in reality will heat the gas more strongly closer to the sources. We develop a framework for calculating fluctuations in the 21-cm brightness temperature that originate from this spatial variation in the heating rate. High-redshift sources are highly clustered, leading to significant gas temperature fluctuations (with fractional variations ~40 per cent, peaking on k ~ 0.1Mpc-1 scales). This induces a distinctive peak-trough structure in the angle-averaged 21-cm power spectrum, which may be accessible to the proposed Square Kilometre Array. This signal reaches the ~10 mK level, and is stronger than that induced by Lyα flux fluctuations. As well as probing the thermal evolution of the IGM before reionization, this 21-cm signal contains information about the spectra of the first X-ray sources. Finally, we consider disentangling temperature, density and Lyα flux fluctuations as functions of redshift.},

title = {The GMRT EoR Experiment: Limits on Polarized Sky Brightness at 150 MHz},
abstract = {The GMRT reionization effort aims to map out the large scale structure of the Universe during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Removal of polarized Galactic emission is a difficult part of any 21 cm EoR program, and we present new upper limits to diffuse polarized foregrounds at 150 MHz. We find no high significance evidence of polarized emission in our observed field at mid galactic latitude (J2000 08h26m+26). We find an upper limit on the 2-dimensional angular power spectrum of diffuse polarized foregrounds of [l^2 C_l/(2 PI)]^{1/2}< 3K in frequency bins of width 1 MHz at 300<l<1000. The 3-dimensional power spectrum of polarized emission, which is most directly relevant to EoR observations, is [k^3 P_p(k)/(2 PI^2)]^{1/2}< 2K at k_perp > 0.03 h/Mpc, k < 0.1 h/Mpc. This can be compared to the expected EoR signal in total intensity of [k^3 P(k)/ (2 PI^2) ]^{1/2} ~ 10 mK. We find polarized structure is substantially weaker than suggested by extrapolation from higher frequency observations, so the new low upper limits reported here reduce the anticipated impact of these foregrounds on EoR experiments. We discuss Faraday beam and depth depolarization models and compare predictions of these models to our data. We report on a new technique for polarization calibration using pulsars, as well as a new technique to remove broadband radio frequency interference. Our data indicate that, on the edges of the main beam at GMRT, polarization squint creates ~ 3% leakage of unpolarized power into polarized maps at zero rotation measure. Ionospheric rotation was largely stable during these solar minimum night time observations.},

title = {Taxing the rich: recombinations and bubble growth during reionization},
abstract = {Reionization is inhomogeneous for two reasons: the clumpiness of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and clustering of the discrete ionizing sources. While numerical simulations can in principle take both into account, they are at present limited by small box sizes. On the other hand, analytic models have only examined the limiting cases of a clumpy IGM (with uniform ionizing emissivity) and clustered sources (embedded in a uniform IGM). Here, we present the first analytic model that includes both factors. At first, recombinations can be ignored and ionized bubbles grow primarily through major mergers, because at any given moment the bubbles have a well-defined characteristic size. As a result, reionization resembles `punctuated equilibrium,' with a series of well-separated sharp jumps in the ionizing background. These features are local effects and do not reflect similar jumps in the global ionized fraction. We then combine our bubble model with a simple description of recombinations in the IGM. We show that the bubbles grow until recombinations balance ionizations, when their expansion abruptly halts. If the IGM density structure is similar to that at moderate redshifts, this limits the bubble radii to ~20 comoving Mpc; however, if the IGM is significantly clumpier at higher redshifts (because of minihalo formation, for example), the limit could be much smaller. Once a bubble reaches saturation, that region of the Universe has for all intents and purposes entered the `post-overlap' stage. Because different HII regions saturate over a finite time interval, the overlap epoch actually has a finite width. Our model also predicts a mean recombination rate several times larger than expected for a uniformly illuminated IGM. This picture naturally explains the substantial large-scale variation in Lyman-series opacity along the lines of sight to the known z > 6 quasars. More quasar spectra will shed light on the transition between the `bubble-dominated' topology characteristic of reionization and the `web-dominated' topology characteristic of the later Universe.},

title = {Observation of GeV Solar Energetic Particles from the 1997 November 6 Event Using Milagrito},
abstract = {Milagrito was an extensive air-shower observatory that served as a prototype for the larger Milagro instrument. Milagrito operated from 1997 February to 1998 May. Although it was designed as a very high energy (few hundred GeV threshold) water-Cerenkov gamma-ray observatory, it could also be used to study solar energetic particles (SEPs). By recording scaler data, which correspond to photomultiplier tube singles rates, it was sensitive to muons and small showers from hadronic primary particles with rigidities above ~4 GV. Milagrito simultaneously recorded air-shower trigger data of primary particles with energies greater than ~100 GeV that provide the data to help reconstruct event directions. The Milagrito scalers registered a ground-level enhancement associated with the 1997 November 6 SEP event and X9 solar flare. At its peak, the enhancement was 22 times the background rms fluctuations. Based on comparisons to neutron monitor and satellite data, we find evidence that the rigidity power-law spectrum for the differential flux of energetic protons steepened above ~4 GV and that the acceleration site was high in the corona (at ~3 Rsolar above the photosphere), assuming that a CME-driven shock was responsible for the ground-level enhancement.},

title = {The LOFAR EoR Data Model: (I) Effects of Noise and Instrumental  Corruptions on the 21-cm Reionization Signal-Extraction Strategy},
abstract = { A number of experiments are set to measure the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The common denominator of these experiments are the large data sets produced, contaminated by various instrumental effects, ionospheric distortions, RFI and strong Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the Data Model that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) EoR Key Science Project (LOFAR EoR KSP). Using this data model we simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band, taking properly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions (e.g. direction-dependent gains, complex gains, polarization effects, noise, etc). We then apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense, assuming that the calibration errors are random Gaussian variates at a level consistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the LOFAR Core Station 1. Our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric measurement affect the quality of the calibrated data, how errors correlate and propagate, and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies. We present results of these simulations and the inversion process and extraction procedure. We also discuss some general properties of the coherency matrix and Jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration problem of aperture synthesis arrays. We conclude that even in the presence of realistic noise and instrumental errors, the statistical signature of the EoR signal can be detected by LOFAR with relatively small errors. A detailed study of the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental models will be considered in the future. },

title = {Simulating full-sky interferometric observations},
abstract = {Aperture array interferometers, such as that proposed for the Square Kilometre Array, will see the entire sky, hence the standard approach to simulating visibilities will not be applicable since it relies on a tangent plane approximation that is valid only for small fields of view. We derive interferometric formulations in real, spherical harmonic and wavelet space that include contributions over the entire sky and do not rely on any tangent plane approximations. A fast wavelet method is developed to simulate the visibilities observed by an interferometer in the full-sky setting. Computing visibilities using the fast wavelet method adapts to the sparse representation of the primary beam and sky intensity in the wavelet basis. Consequently, the fast wavelet method exhibits superior computational complexity to the real and spherical harmonic space methods and may be performed at substantially lower computational cost, while introducing only negligible error to simulated visibilities. Low-resolution interferometric observations are simulated using all of the methods to compare their performance, demonstrating that the fast wavelet method is approximately three times faster than the other methods for these low-resolution simulations. The computational burden of the real and spherical harmonic space methods renders these techniques computationally infeasible for higher resolution simulations. High-resolution interferometric observations are simulated using the fast wavelet method only, demonstrating and validating the application of this method to realistic simulations. The fast wavelet method is estimated to provide a greater than 10-fold reduction in execution time compared to the other methods for these high-resolution simulations.},

title = {Detection and extraction of signals from the epoch of reionization using higher-order one-point statistics},
abstract = {Detecting redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the early Universe promises to give direct constraints on the epoch of reionization (EoR). It will, though, be very challenging to extract the cosmological signal (CS) from foregrounds and noise which are orders of magnitude larger. Fortunately, the signal has some characteristics which differentiate it from the foregrounds and noise, and we suggest that using the correct statistics may tease out signatures of reionization. We generate mock data cubes simulating the output of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) EoR experiment. These cubes combine realistic models for Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the noise with three different simulations of the CS. We fit out the foregrounds, which are smooth in the frequency direction, to produce residual images in each frequency band. We denoise these images and study the skewness of the one-point distribution in the images as a function of frequency. We find that, under sufficiently optimistic assumptions, we can recover the main features of the redshift evolution of the skewness in the 21-cm signal. We argue that some of these features - such as a dip at the onset of reionization, followed by a rise towards its later stages - may be generic, and give us a promising route to a statistical detection of reionization.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of spatial variations in the ionized fraction during reionization on temperature anisotropies in the CMB. We combine simulations of large-scale structure to describe the underlying density field with an analytic model based on extended Press-Schechter theory to track the reionization process. We find that the power spectrum of the induced CMB anisotropies depends sensitively on the character of the reionization epoch. Models that differ in the extent of the ``patchy phase'' could be distinguished by future experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT). In our models, the patchy signal peaks at l~=2000, where it can be 4 times larger than the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)/Ostriker-Vishniac (OV) signal (ΔTtot~=2.6 μK). On scales beyond l~=4000 the total Doppler signal is dominated by kSZ/OV, but the patchy signal can contribute up to 30% to the power spectrum. The effect of patchy reionization is largest on scales on which the primordial CMB anisotropies dominate. Ignoring this contribution could lead to significant biases in the determination of cosmological parameters derived from CMB temperature measurements. Improvements in the theoretical modeling of the reionization epoch will become increasingly important to interpret the results of upcoming experiments.},

title = {Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Cosmological Interpretation},
abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Λ cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω b h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 --0.00059, Ω c h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, τ = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive σ8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc--1, Ω b = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Ω c = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Ω m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 --0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: --0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and --0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as --0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than --5fdg9 < Δα < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of {\Sigma}m ν < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are --9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and --151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

title = {Probing the Dark Ages with the Square Kilometer Array},
abstract = {The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be one of a suite of new, large telescopes for the 21st century probing fundamental physics, the origin and evolution of the Universe, the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the formation and distribution of planets. The epoch of reionization (EoR) sets a fundamental benchmark in cosmic structure formation, corresponding to the formation of the first luminous objects that ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z > 6. The SKA will provide critical insight into the EoR in a number of ways (for a review, see Carilli et al. 2004, NewAR, 48, 1029). First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral 'cosmic web', as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM.

title = {TeV Gamma-Ray Survey of the Northern Hemisphere Sky Using the Milagro Observatory},
abstract = {Milagro is a water Cerenkov extensive air shower array that continuously monitors the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy band. The results from an analysis of ~3 yr of data (2000 December-2003 November) are presented. The data have been searched for steady point sources of TeV gamma rays between declinations of 1.1d and 80$\,^{\circ}$. Two sources are detected, the Crab Nebula and the active galaxy Mrk 421. For the remainder of the northern hemisphere, we set 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits between 275 and 600 mcrab (4.8×10-12 to 10.5×10-12 cm-2 s-1) above 1 TeV for source declinations between 5$\,^{\circ}$ and 70$\,^{\circ}$. Since the sensitivity of Milagro depends on the spectrum of the source at the top of the atmosphere, the dependence of the limits on the spectrum of a candidate source is presented. Because high-energy gamma rays from extragalactic sources are absorbed by interactions with the extragalactic background light, the dependence of the flux limits on the redshift of a candidate source are given. The upper limits presented here are over an order of magnitude more stringent than previously published limits from TeV gamma-ray all-sky surveys.},

title = {An advanced analysis technique for transient searches in wide-field gamma-ray observatories},
abstract = {Wide-field gamma-ray telescopes typically have highly variable event-by-event resolution which leads to a number of unique and challenging analysis requirements--particularly when conducting transient searches over multiple time scales. By generalizing the ideas of the Gaussian weighting analysis to point-spread functions of arbitrary shape and the regime of Poisson statistics, an efficient analysis which uses the event-by-event resolution is developed with a sensitivity similar to that of a well-implemented maximum likelihood analysis. In this development, the effect of a number of different approximations on the sensitivity and speed of the final analysis can be easily determined and tuned to the particular application. The analysis method is particularly well suited to transient detection in wide field-of-view gamma-ray observatories, and is currently used for the 40 s-3 h transient search in the Milagro observatory.},

title = {Heliospheric Experiments Planned with the Mileura Widefield Array Demonstrator},
abstract = {Low frequency radio telescopes, like the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA), are expected to grow into important tools for space weather and heliospheric studies because of their ability to conduct observations in the vast inner heliosphere and their potentially unique ability to constrain the heliospheric magnetic field. As a first step towards MWA a demonstrator array is being constructed at an exquisitely radio quiet site in Mileura, Western Australia. The demonstrator for the MWA will cover the frequency range from 80 to 300 MHz with 32 MHz bandwidth and will consist of ~500 stations, each comprising 16 dual polarization dipoles. The demonstrator will be 1.5 km in diameter, have a field of view of ~20 and 60 deg, and provide a resolution of 2.3 and 6.9 arcmin at 300 and 100 MHz respectively. It will have a collecting area of 8600 m2 and a point source sensitivity of 0.03 Jy at 200 MHz (32 MHz bandwidth and 1 sec time integration). The primary backends of the demonstrator will be a Full Field of view Imager, which will provide a full polarization image of the entire field of view every second, and a beamformer capable of providing 8-16 independent beams per polarization which can be placed anywhere within the large field of view. The MWA demonstrator will have enough collecting area and sufficiently sophisticated backends to conduct significant scientific investigations. This paper will present the plans for heliospheric science applications planned for the demonstrator. These comprise Interplanetary Scintillations (IPS) and Faraday Rotation (FR) observations. IPS measurements yield information about the solar wind velocity, density and turbulence, and FR observations constrain the magnetic field strength and orientation in both the quiescent heliosphere and transients like Coronal Mass Ejections. The first scientific observations will be a survey of the southern skies to identify sources suitable for IPS and FR observations. IPS and FR observations of Coronal Mass Ejections and the quiescent heliosphere, and the subsequent analysis to estimate their plasma properties and magnetic field orientation will be conducted on a campaign basis.},

title = {Modification of the 21-cm power spectrum by quasars during the epoch of reionization},
abstract = {We assess the effect of a population of high-redshift quasars on the 21-cm power spectrum during the epoch of reionization. Our approach is to implement a seminumerical scheme to calculate the three-dimensional structure of ionized regions surrounding massive haloes at high redshift. We include the ionizing influence of luminous quasars by populating a simulated overdensity field with quasars using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. We find that quasars modify both the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum at a level which is of the same order as the fractional contribution to reionization. The modification is found both at constant redshift and at constant global neutral fraction, and arises because ionizing photons produced by quasars are biased relative to the density field at a level that is higher than stellar ionizing photons. The modification of the power spectrum is likely to be small, rendering the effect of quasars difficult to isolate. However, we find the modification of the power spectrum by quasars to be at a level that is comparable to the precision expected for future low-frequency telescopes. Correct interpretation of observations will therefore require the effect of quasars to be considered, and our results imply that quasar ionization will need to be included in detailed modelling of observed 21-cm power spectra.},

We report evidence for a TeV gamma-ray signal from a region of the galactic plane by Milagro, a large-field-of-view water Cherenkov detector for extensive air showers. An excess with a significance of 4.5 standard deviations has been observed from the region of galactic longitude l∈(40$\,^{\circ}$,100$\,^{\circ}$) and latitude |b|<5$\,^{\circ}$. Under the assumption of a simple power law spectrum, with no cutoff in the EGRET-Milagro energy range, the measured integral flux is ϕγ(>3.5 TeV)=(6.4$\pm$1.4$\pm$2.1)×10-11 cm-2 s-1 sr-1. This flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the EGRET spectrum between 1 and 30 GeV in this galactic region.},

title = {Constraining Anisotropic Baryon Oscillations},
abstract = {We present an analysis of anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillations and elucidate how a mis-estimation of the cosmology, which leads to incorrect values of the angular diameter distance, d_A, and Hubble parameter, H, manifest themselves in changes to the monopole and quadrupole power spectrum of biased tracers of the density field. Previous work has focused on the monopole power spectrum, and shown that the isotropic "dilation" combination d_A^2/H is robustly constrained by an overall shift in the scale of the baryon feature. We extend this by demonstrating that the quadrupole power spectrum is sensitive to an anisotropic "warping" mode d_A H, allowing one to break the degeneracy between d_A and H. We describe a method for measuring this warping, explicitly marginalizing over the form of redshift space distortions. We verify this method on N-body simulations and estimate that d_A H can be measured with a fractional accuracy of ~ 3/sqrt(V) % where the survey volume is estimated in (Gpc/h)^3.},

title = {Non-parametric foreground subtraction for 21-cm epoch of reionization experiments},
abstract = {One of the problems facing experiments designed to detect redshifted 21-cm emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR) is the presence of foregrounds which exceed the cosmological signal in intensity by orders of magnitude. While fitting them so that they can be removed, we must be careful to minimize `overfitting', in which we fit away some of the cosmological signal, and `underfitting', in which real features of the foregrounds cannot be captured by the fit, polluting the signal reconstruction. We argue that in principle it would be better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to determine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance and then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other problems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method, Wp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles of Wp smoothing, we describe an algorithm used to implement it. Some useful results for implementing an alternative algorithm are given in an appendix. We apply Wp smoothing to a synthetic data cube for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) EoR experiment. This cube includes realistic models for the signal, foregrounds, instrumental response and noise. The performance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to recover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids the fitting residuals being polluted by leakage of power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to another non-parametric method (smoothing splines). We find that Wp smoothing is superior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive with parametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functional form of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. Finally, we discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolution and range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edge effects.},

title = {Statistical Probes of Reionization with 21 Centimeter Tomography},
abstract = {We consider the degree to which 21 cm tomography of the high-redshift universe can distinguish different ionization histories. Using a new analytic model for the size distribution of H II regions that associates these ionized bubbles with large-scale galaxy overdensities, we compute the angular power spectrum and other statistical properties of the 21 cm brightness temperature during reionization. We show that the H II regions imprint features on the power spectrum that allow us to separate histories with discrete bubbles from those with partial uniform ionization (by, for example, X-rays). We also show that ``double reionization'' scenarios will modify the morphology of the bubbles in ways that depend on the mechanism through which the first generation of sources shuts off. If, for example, the transition occurs globally at a fixed redshift, the first generation imprints a persistent feature on the 21 cm power spectrum. Finally, we compare our model to one in which voids are ionized first. While the power spectra of these two models are qualitatively similar, we show that the underlying distributions of neutral hydrogen differ dramatically and suggest that other statistical tests can distinguish them. The next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes will have the sensitivity to distinguish all of these models and strongly constrain the history and morphology of reionization.},

The instrument was deployed at the South Pole in the austral summer 1999-2000, and we made observations throughout the following austral winter. We present a measurement of the CMB angular power spectrum in the range 100<l<900 in nine bands with fractional uncertainties in the range 10%-20% and dominated by sample variance. In this paper, we review the formalism used in the analysis, in particular the use of constraint matrices to project out contaminants such as ground and point source signals and to test for correlations with diffuse foreground templates. We find no evidence of foregrounds other than point sources in the data, and we find a maximum likelihood temperature spectral index β=-0.1+/-0.2 (1 σ), consistent with CMB. We detect a first peak in the power spectrum at l~200, in agreement with previous experiments. In addition, we detect a peak in the power spectrum at l~550 and power of similar magnitude at l~800, which are consistent with the second and third harmonic peaks predicted by adiabatic inflationary cosmological models.},

Detection of this signal is complicated by contamination from foreground sources such as diffuse Galactic synchrotron and free-free emission at low radio frequencies, extragalactic free-free emission from ionized regions, and radio point sources. We model these foregrounds to determine the extent to which 21 cm fluctuations can be detected with upcoming experiments. We find that not only the level of correlation from one frequency to another but also the functional form of the foreground correlations has a substantial impact on foreground removal. We calculate how well the angular power spectra of the 21 cm fluctuations can be determined. We also show that the large-scale bias of the neutral hydrogen gas distribution with respect to the density field can be determined with high precision and used to distinguish between different reionization histories.},

title = {Weak Gravitational Lensing of High-Redshift 21 cm Power Spectra},
abstract = {We describe the effects of weak gravitational lensing by cosmological large-scale structure on the diffuse emission of 21 cm radiation from high-redshift neutral hydrogen during the era of reionization. The ability to observe three-dimensional information suggests that 21 cm studies may provide a useful context for weak-lensing studies. We focus on the gravitational lensing effects on both the angular power spectra and the intrinsic, three-dimensional power spectra. We present a new approach for calculating the weak-lensing signature that reduces to coupled systems of differential equations in a lensing cutoff scale, which are solved by approximating the magnification matrix. This method is applied to reionization models of the 21 cm background spectra up to small angular scales over a range in redshift. The effect on the angular power spectrum is typically less than 1% on small angular scales, and very small on scales corresponding to the feature imprinted by reionization bubbles, due to the near-scale invariance of the 21 cm angular power spectrum on these scales. We describe the expected effect of weak lensing on three-dimensional 21 cm power spectra, and show that lensing creates aspherical perturbations to the intrinsic power spectrum that depend on the polar angle of the wavevector. The effect on the three-dimensional power spectrum is less than 1% on scales k<~0.1 h Mpc-1, but can be >~1% for highly inclined modes for k>~1 h Mpc-1. The angular variation of the lensing effect on these scales is well described by a quartic polynomial in the cosine of the polar angle. The detection of the gravitational lensing effects on 21 cm power spectra will require very sensitive, high-resolution observations by future low-frequency radio arrays.},

title = {Prospects for Redshifted 21 cm Observations of Quasar H II Regions},
abstract = {The introduction of low-frequency radio arrays over the coming decade is expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of the contrast in redshifted 21 cm emission between a large H II region and the surrounding neutral IGM will be the simplest and most easily interpreted signature. We assess the sensitivity of three generations of planned low-frequency arrays to quasar-generated H II regions. We find that an instrument such as the planned Mileura Widefield Array Low Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) will be able to obtain good signal-to-noise ratios on H II regions around the most luminous quasars and determine some gross geometric properties, e.g., whether the H II region is spherical or conical. A hypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the LFD (MWA-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of H II regions, while the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features, as well as the sharpness of the H II region boundary. The SKA will most likely be limited by irreducible noise from fluctuations in the IGM itself. The MWA-5000 (and even the LFD under favorable circumstances) will discover serendipitous H II regions in wide-field observations. We estimate the number of H II regions that are expected to be generated by quasars based on the observed number counts of quasars at z~6. Assuming a late reionization at z~6, we find that there should be several tens of quasar H II regions larger than 4 Mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. Identification of H II regions in forthcoming 21 cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies in the middle of these regions. Most of the discovered galaxies would be the massive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil H II cavities that persisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombination time of intergalactic hydrogen. A snapshot survey of candidate H II regions selected in redshifted 21 cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficient method for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.},

However, these observations are complicated by a host of strong foreground sources. Several foreground removal techniques have been proposed in the literature, and it has been assumed that these would be used in combination to reveal the Epoch of Reionization (EOR) signal. By studying the characteristic subtraction errors of the proposed foreground removal techniques, we identify an additional subtraction stage that can further reduce the EOR foreground contamination, and study the interactions between the foreground removal algorithms. This enables us to outline a comprehensive foreground removal strategy that incorporates all previously proposed subtraction techniques.},

title = {The SDSS Damped Lyα Survey: Data Release 3},
abstract = {We present the results from a damped Lyα survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 3. We have discovered over 500 new damped Lyα systems at z>2.2, and the complete statistical sample for z>1.6 has more than 600 damped Lyα galaxies. We measure the H I column density distribution fHI(N, X) and its zeroth and first moments (the incidence lDLA and gas mass density ΩDLAg of damped Lyα systems, respectively) as a function of redshift. The key results include: (1) the full SDSS DR3 fHI(N, X) distribution (z~3.06) is well fit by a Γ function (or double power law) with ``break'' column density Nγ=1021.5+/-0.1 cm-2 and ``faint-end'' slope α=-1.8+/-0.1 (2) the shape of the fHI(N, X) distributions in a series of redshift bins does not show evolution; (3) the incidence and gas mass density of damped systems decrease by 35%+/-9% and 50%+/-10% during ~1 Gyr between the redshift intervals z=[3.0, 3.5] and z=[2.2, 2.5] and (4) the incidence and gas mass density of damped Lyα systems in the lowest SDSS redshift bin (z=2.2) are consistent with the current values. We investigate a number of systematic errors in damped Lyα analysis and identify only one important effect: we measure 40%+/-20% higher ΩDLAg values toward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect is contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that gravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against several models of galaxy formation in ΛCDM, we find that all of the models significantly underpredict lDLA at z=3, and only SPH models with significant feedback can reproduce ΩDLAg at high redshift. Based on our results for the damped Lyα systems, we argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute ~33% of the universe's H I atoms at all redshifts z=2-5. Furthermore, we infer that the fHI(N, X) distribution for NHI<1020 cm-2 has an inflection with slope dlogf/dlogN>-1. We advocate a new mass density definition, the mass density of predominantly neutral gas Ωneutg, to be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with H I atoms. We contend the damped Lyα systems contribute >80% of Ωneutg at all redshifts and therefore are the main reservoirs for star formation.},

abstract = {21cm emission from residual neutral hydrogen after the epoch of reionization can be used to trace the cosmological power spectrum of density fluctuations. Using a Fisher matrix formulation, we provide a detailed forecast of the constraints on cosmological parameters that are achievable with this probe. We consider two designs: a scaled-up version of the MWA observatory as well as a Fast Fourier Transform Telescope. We find that 21cm observations dedicated to post-reionization redshifts may yield significantly better constraints than next generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. We find the constraints on ΩΛ, Ωmh2, and Ωνh2 to be the strongest, each improved by at least an order of magnitude over the Planck CMB satellite alone for both designs. Our results do not depend as strongly on uncertainties in the astrophysics associated with the ionization of hydrogen as similar 21cm surveys during the epoch of reionization. However, we find that modulation of the 21cm power spectrum from the ionizing background could potentially degrade constraints on the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum and its running by more than an order of magnitude. Our results also depend strongly on the maximum wavenumber of the power spectrum which can be used due to non-linearities.},

title = {Probing dark energy with baryonic oscillations and future radio surveys  of neutral Hydrogen},
abstract = { Current surveys may be on the verge of measuring the baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum which are clearly seen imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background. It has recently been proposed that these oscillations allow a `standard ruler' method of probing the equation of state of dark energy. In this paper we present a new calculation of the number of galaxies future adio telescopes will detect in surveys of the sky in neutral Hydrogen (HI). We estimate the likely statistical errors if the standard ruler method were to be applied to such surveys. We emphasise uncertainties in our calculations, and pinpoint the most important features of future HI surveys if they are to provide new constraints on dark energy via baryonic oscillations. Designs of future radio telescopes are required to have a large bandwidth (characterised by \beta{\$}, the ratio of the instantaneous bandwidth to the bandwidth required by survey) and to have the widest instantaneous (1.4 GHz) field of view ({\$}FOV{\$}) possible. Given the expected sensitivity of a future Square Kilometre Array (SKA), given that half of its collecting area will be concentrated in a core of diameter {\$}\sim 5 ~ \rm km{\$}, and given a reasonable survey duration ({\$}T_0{\$} {\$}\sim{\$} 1 yr), we show that there will be negligible shot noise on a power spectrum derived from HI galaxies out to redshift {\$}z \simeq 1.5{\$}. To access the largest cosmic volume possible by surveying all the sky available, we argue that {\$}\beta{\$}, {\$}T_0{\$} and {\$}FOV{\$} must obey the relation {\$}\beta FOV T_0 \gtsimeq 10 \rm deg^2{\$} yr. An {\$}\sim{\$}1-yr SKA survey would then contain {\$}\gtsimeq 10^{9} (f_{\rm sky}/0.5){\$} HI galaxies and provide constraints on the dark-energy parameter {\$}w{\$} of order {\$}\Delta w \simeq 0.01 (f_{\rm sky}/0.5)^{-0.5}{\$}. },

title = {Mapping Dark Matter with Cosmic Magnification},
abstract = {We develop a new tool to generate statistically precise dark matter maps from the cosmic magnification of galaxies with distance estimates. We show how to overcome the intrinsic clustering problem using the slope of the luminosity function, because magnification changes strongly over the luminosity function, while intrinsic clustering only changes weakly. This may allow precision cosmology beyond most current systematic limitations. The Square Kilometre Array is able to reconstruct the projected matter density map at smoothing scale ˜10' with S/N≥1, at the rate of 200 4000 deg2 per year, depending on the abundance and evolution of 21 cm emitting galaxies. This power of mapping dark matter is comparable to, or even better than, that of cosmic shear from deep optical surveys or 21 cm surveys.},

abstract = {The cosmic reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium is a milestone event in the history of structure formation that strongly impacts later stages of galaxy formation. Recent data indicate that it occurred at z ˜6--10. This era will be probed by a range of instruments in the next several years, including near-infrared telescopes, CMB telescopes, and low-frequency radio arrays. We will review our theoretical expectations of this process and describe how it can be used to constrain the properties of the first galaxies and quasars. In the initial stages, reionization is driven by the clustering of luminous sources. Toward the end, inhomogeneous recombinations in the cosmic web take over. Future progress in understanding the process will come from a mix of analytic modeling and numerical simulations. We will also compare the reionization of helium, due to quasars at z ˜3, to that of hydrogen and show how it can illuminate the higher-redshift event.},

title = {Correcting direction-dependent gains in the deconvolution of radio interferometric images},
abstract = {Astronomical imaging using aperture synthesis telescopes requires deconvolution of the point spread function as well as calibration of instrumental and atmospheric effects. In general, such effects are time-variable and vary across the field of view as well, resulting in direction-dependent (DD), time-varying gains. Most existing imaging and calibration algorithms assume that the corruptions are direction independent, preventing even moderate dynamic range full-beam, full-Stokes imaging. We present a general framework for imaging algorithms which incorporate DD errors. We describe as well an iterative deconvolution algorithm that corrects known DD errors due to the antenna power patterns (including errors due to the antenna polarization response) as well as pointing errors for high dynamic range full-beam polarimetric imaging. Using simulations we demonstrate that errors due to realistic primary beams as well as antenna pointing errors will limit the dynamic range of upcoming higher sensitivity instruments like the EVLA and ALMA and that our new algorithm can be used to correct for such errors. We show that the technique described here corrects for effects that can be described as approximate unitary operators in the interferometric measurement equation, such as those due to antenna pointing errors and non-azimuthally symmetric antenna power patterns. We have applied this algorithm to VLA 1.4 GHz observations of a field that contains two ``4C'' sources and have obtained Stokes I and V images with systematic errors that are one order of magnitude lower than those obtained with conventional imaging tools. Residual systematic errors that are seen at a level slightly above that of the thermal noise are likely due to selfcalibration instabilities that are triggered by a combination of unknown pointing errors and errors in our assumption of the shape of the primary beam of each antenna. We hope to present a more refined algorithm to deal with the fully general case in due course. Our simulations show that on data with no other calibration errors, the algorithm corrects pointing errors as well as errors due to known asymmetries in the antenna pattern.},

abstract = {The Milagro telescope monitors the northern sky for 100 GeV - 100 TeV transient emission through continuous very high energy wide-field observations. The large effective area and low energy threshold of Milagro allow it to detect very high energy gamma-ray burst emission with much higher sensitivity than previous instruments, and a fluence sensitivity at TeV energies comparable to dedicated gamma-ray burst satellites at keV-MeV energies. Observation of gamma-ray burst emission at TeV energies could place important constraints on gamma-ray burst progenitor and emission models. This study details the development of a weighted analysis technique; the implementation of this technique to perform a real time search for TeV transients of 40 seconds to 3 hours duration in the Milagro data; and the results from more than one year of observation. Between May 2nd, 2001, and May 22nd, 2002, no TeV transients of 40 seconds to 3 hours duration were observed. Upper limits on both observed and emitted high energy gamma-ray burst emission are presented.},

abstract = {Understanding diffuse Galactic radio emission is interesting both in its own right and for minimizing foreground contamination of cosmological measurements. cosmic microwave background experiments have focused on frequencies >~10GHz, whereas 21-cm tomography of the high-redshift universe will mainly focus on <~0.2GHz, for which less is currently known about Galactic emission. Motivated by this, we present a global sky model derived from all publicly available total power large-area radio surveys, digitized with optical character recognition when necessary and compiled into a uniform format, as well as the new Villa Elisa data extending the 1.42-GHz map to the entire sky. We quantify statistical and systematic uncertainties in these surveys by comparing them with various global multifrequency model fits. We find that a principal component based model with only three components can fit the 11 most accurate data sets (at 10, 22, 45 and 408 MHz and 1.42, 2.326, 23, 33, 41, 61, 94 GHz) to an accuracy around 1-10 per cent depending on frequency and sky region.

abstract = { We show that the class of antenna layouts for telescope arrays allowing cheap analysis hardware (with cost scaling as N log N rather than N^2 with the number of antennae N) is encouragingly large, including not only previously discussed rectangular grids but also arbitrary hierarchies of such grids, with arbitrary rotations and shears at each level. We show that all correlations for such a 2D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a Fast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2n dimensions. This allows major cost reductions for science applications requiring sensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21cm tomography (where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long baselines are needed for point source removal). Such hierarchical grids combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional array layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform Telescope. We also describe an algorithm for how a subclass of hierarchical arrays can efficiently use rotation synthesis to produce global sky maps with minimal noise and a well-characterized synthesized beam. },

title = {The correlation between star formation and 21-cm emission during the reionization epoch},
abstract = {Reionization is thought to be dominated by low-mass galaxies, while direct observations of resolved galaxies probe only the most massive, rarest objects. The cross-correlation between fluctuations in the surface brightness of the cumulative Lyα emission (which serves as a proxy for the star formation rate) and the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) will directly probe the causal link between the production of ionizing photons in galaxies and the reionization of the IGM. We discuss the prospects for detecting this cross-correlation for unresolved galaxies. We find that on angular scales <~10 arcmin detection will be practical using wide-field near-infrared (near-IR) imaging from space in combination with the forthcoming Mileura Wide-field Array - Low Frequency Demonstrator. When redshifted 21-cm observations of the neutral IGM are combined with space-based near-IR imaging of Lyα emission, the detection on angular scales <~3 arcmin will be limited by the sensitivity of the 21-cm signal, even when a small-aperture optical telescope (~2 m) and a moderate field of view (~10 deg2) are used. On scales >~3 arcmin, the measurement of cross-correlation will be limited by the accuracy of the foreground sky subtraction.},

title = {Observational Constraints on Cosmic Reionization},
abstract = {Observations have set the first constraints on the epoch of reionization (EoR), corresponding to the formation epoch of the first luminous objects. Studies of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption indicate a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from xHI < 10 4 at z ≤ 5.5, to xHI > 10 3, perhaps up to 0.1, at z 6, while the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) implies a significant ionization fraction extending to higher redshifts, z 11 $\pm$ 3. These results, as well as observations of galaxy populations, suggest that reionization is a process that begins as early as z 14, and ends with the "percolation" phase at z 6 to 8. Low luminosity star-forming galaxies are likely the dominant sources of reionizing photons. Future low-frequency radio telescopes will make direct measurements of HI 21-cm emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and measurements of secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide details of the dynamics of the reionized IGM.},

title = {Calibration of Low-Frequency, Wide-Field Radio Interferometers Using Delay/Delay-Rate Filtering},
abstract = {We present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional "delay images," and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional "delay/delay-rate images." Source selection is possible in these images given appropriate combinations of baseline, bandwidth, integration time, and source location. Strong and persistent radio frequency interference (RFI) limits the effectiveness of this source selection owing to the removal of data by RFI excision algorithms. A one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for RFI-excision effects. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields of view.},

title = {Foreground Contamination in Interferometric Measurements of the Redshifted 21 cm Power Spectrum},
abstract = {Subtraction of astrophysical foreground contamination from "dirty" sky maps produced by simulated measurements of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has been performed by fitting a third-order polynomial along the spectral dimension of each pixel in the data cubes. The simulations are the first to include the unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional spherically binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum within ~1% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 lsim k lsim 1 Mpc--1) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the epoch of reionization signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense uv-coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and produced very good results on scales corresponding to |u| lsim 500λ in the uv-plane without any selective editing of the uv-coverage.},

title = {Foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line. I. First Westerbork measurements of Galactic emission at 150 MHz in a low latitude field},
abstract = {Context: The cosmological 21 cm line promises to be a formidable tool for cosmology, allowing the investigation of the end of the so-called dark ages, when the first galaxies formed. Aims: Astrophysical foregrounds are expected to be about three orders of magnitude greater than the cosmological signal and therefore represent a serious contamination of the cosmological 21 cm line. Detailed knowledge of both their intensity and polarization structure on the relevant angular scale of 1-30 arcmin will be essential for extracting the cosmological signal from the data. Methods: We present the first results from a series of observations conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimed at characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionization experiments. The polarization data were analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We computed total intensity and polarization angular power spectra. Results: For the first time we have detected fluctuations in the Galactic diffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 MHz, in the low Galactic latitude area known as Fan region, centred at α = 3^h10^m, δ = 65$\,^{\circ}$ 30'. Those fluctuations have an rms of 14 K. The total intensity power spectrum shows a power-law behaviour down to ℓ 900 with slope β^I_ℓ = -2.2 $\pm$ 0.3. The detection of diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point sources. We measured an rms confusion noise of 3 mJy beam-1. Diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at this frequency. The polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially and along the line of sight. The polarization power spectrum is not affected by residual point sources and is only limited by the thermal noise. It shows a power-law behaviour down to ℓ 2700 with slope β^P_ℓ = -1.65 $\pm$ 0.15. The rms of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 K on 4 arcmin scales. Conclusions: The measured total intensity fluctuations are used to estimate the foreground contamination on the cosmological signal. By extrapolating the spectrum of total intensity emission, we find a contamination of δ T= √{ℓ (ℓ+1) C^I_ℓ / 2π} ˜ 5.7 K on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding rms value of 18.3 K at the same angular scale. The level of the polarization power spectrum is δ T 3.3 K on 5 arcmin scales. However, the Fan region cannot be taken as representative of other sky regions, given its exceptionally bright polarized signal, but is likely to represent an upper limit on the sky brightness at moderate and high Galactic latitude.},

title = {Limits on Very High Energy Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Milagro Observatory},
abstract = {The Milagro telescope monitors the northern sky for 100 GeV-100 TeV transient emission through continuous very high energy (VHE) wide-field observations. The large effective area and ~100 GeV energy threshold of Milagro allow it to detect VHE gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission with much higher sensitivity than previous instruments and a fluence sensitivity at VHE energies comparable to that of dedicated GRB satellites at keV-MeV energies. Even in the absence of a positive detection, VHE observations can place important constraints on GRB progenitor and emission models. We present limits on the VHE flux of 40 s-3 hr duration transients near Earth as well as sensitivity distributions that have been corrected for gamma-ray absorption by extragalactic background light and cosmological effects. The sensitivity distributions suggest that the typical intrinsic VHE fluence of GRBs is similar to or weaker than the keV-MeV emission, and we demonstrate how these sensitivity distributions may be used to place observational constraints on the absolute VHE luminosity of GRBs for any GRB emission and progenitor model.},

Air Cerenkov telescopes have developed and perfected the ``imaging'' technique over the past several decades. However, until now no background rejection method has been successfully used in an air shower array to detect a source of TeV gamma rays. We report on a method to differentiate hadronic air showers from electromagnetic air showers in the Milagro gamma-ray observatory, based on the ability to detect the energetic particles in an extensive air shower. The technique is used to detect TeV emission from the Crab Nebula.

title = {Foregrounds for 21-cm observations of neutral gas at high redshift},
abstract = {We investigate a number of potential foregrounds for an ambitious goal of future radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR): spatial tomography of neutral gas at high redshift in 21-cm emission. While the expected temperature fluctuations due to unresolved radio point sources is highly uncertain, we point out that free-free emission from the ionizing haloes that reionized the Universe should define a minimal bound. This emission is likely to swamp the expected brightness temperature fluctuations, making proposed detections of the angular patchwork of 21-cm emission across the sky unlikely to be viable. Hα observations with JWST could place an upper bound on the contribution of high-redshift sources to the free-free background. An alternative approach is to discern the topology of reionization from spectral features due to 21-cm emission along a pencil-beam slice. This requires tight control of the frequency-dependence of the beam in order to prevent foreground sources from contributing excessive variance. We also investigate potential contamination by galactic and extragalactic radio recombination lines (RRLs). These are unlikely to be show-stoppers, although little is known about the distribution of RRLs away from the Galactic plane. The mini-halo emission signal is always less than that of the intergalactic medium (IGM), making mini-haloes unlikely to be detectable. If they are seen, it will be only in the very earliest stages of structure formation at high redshift, when the spin temperature of the IGM has not yet decoupled from the cosmic microwave background.},

title = {Studying reionization with Lyα emitters},
abstract = {We show that observations of high-redshift Lyα emitters (LAEs) have the potential to provide definitive evidence for reionization in the near future. Using 200-Mpc radiative transfer simulations, we calculate the effect that patchy reionization has on the line profile, on the luminosity function, and, most interestingly, on the clustering of emitters for several realistic models of reionization. Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters, and we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attribute to anything other than reionization. Our results motivate looking for the signature of reionization in existing LAE data. We find that for stellar reionization scenarios the angular correlation function of the 58 LAEs in the Subaru Deep Field z = 6.6 photometric sample is more consistent with a fully ionized universe (mean volume ionized fraction than a universe with at >2σ confidence level. Measurements in the next year on Subaru will increase their z = 6.6 LAE sample by a factor of 5 and tighten these limits. If the clustering signature of reionization is detected in an LAE survey, a comparison with a Lyman-break or an Hα survey in the same field would confirm the reionization hypothesis. We discuss the optimal LAE survey specifications for detecting reionization, with reference to upcoming programmes.},

title = {Report of the Dark Energy Task Force},
abstract = {Dark energy appears to be the dominant component of the physical Universe, yet there is no persuasive theoretical explanation for its existence or magnitude. The acceleration of the Universe is, along with dark matter, the observed phenomenon that most directly demonstrates that our theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either incorrect or incomplete. Most experts believe that nothing short of a revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a full understanding of the cosmic acceleration. For these reasons, the nature of dark energy ranks among the very most compelling of all outstanding problems in physical science. These circumstances demand an ambitious observational program to determine the dark energy properties as well as possible.},

title = {Baryonic acoustic oscillations in 21-cm emission: a probe of dark energy out to high redshifts},
abstract = {Low-frequency observatories are currently being constructed with the goal of detecting redshifted 21-cm emission from the epoch of reionization. These observatories will also be able to detect intensity fluctuations in the cumulative 21-cm emission after reionization, from hydrogen in unresolved damped Lyα absorbers (such as gas-rich galaxies) down to a redshift z ~ 3.5. The inferred power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations at all redshifts will show acoustic oscillations, whose comoving scale can be used as a standard ruler to infer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy. We find that the first generation of low-frequency experiments (such as MWA or LOFAR) will be able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few per cent in a redshift window just prior to the end of the reionization era, provided that foregrounds can be removed over frequency bandpasses of >~8MHz. This sensitivity to the acoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxy redshift surveys, but at much higher redshifts. Future extensions of the first-generation experiments (involving an order of magnitude increase in the antennae number of the MWA) could reach sensitivities below 1 per cent in several redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in the unexplored redshift regime of 3.5 <~ z <~ 12. Moreover, new experiments with antennae designed to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements (<~1 per cent) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts (1.5 <~ z <~ 3.5), where they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveys covering more than 1000 deg2. Together with other data sets, observations of 21-cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acoustic scale from the present time out to z ~ 12.},

Fixed cylinders can be built for low cost, and long cylinders also allow low cost fast fourier transform techniques to be used to define thousands of simultaneous beams. A survey made with fixed reflectors naturally covers all of the sky available from it's site with good uniformity, minimizing sample variance in the measurement of the acoustic peak wavelength.

abstract = {Constraints on cosmological parameters from upcoming measurements with the Mileura Wide-field Array Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA LFD) of the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum are forecasted assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology and assuming that the reionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium occurs below a redshift of z=8. We find that observations with the MWA LFD cannot constrain the underlying cosmology in this scenario. In principle, a similar experiment with a 10-fold increase in collecting area could provide useful constraints on the slope of the inflationary power spectrum, ns, and the running of the spectral index, αs, but these constraints are subject to the caveat that even a small reionization contribution could be confused with the cosmological signal. In addition to the redshifted 21 cm signal, we include two nuisance components in our analysis related to the systematics and astrophysical foregrounds present in low-frequency radio observations. These components are found to be well separated from the signal and contribute little uncertainty (<30%) to the measured values of the cosmological model parameters.},

abstract = {Aims. We investigate the properties of the Galactic ISM by applying Faraday tomography to a radio polarization data set in the direction of the Galactic anti-centre. Methods: We address the problem of missing large-scale structure in our data, and show that this does not play an important role for the results we present. Results: The main peak of the Faraday depth spectra in our data set is not measurably resolved for about 8% of the lines of sight. An unresolved peak indicates a separation between the regions with Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission. However, cosmic rays pervade the ISM, and synchrotron emission would therefore also be produced where there is Faraday rotation. We suggest that the orientation of the magnetic field can separate the two effects. By modelling the thermal electron contribution to the Faraday depth, we map the strength of the magnetic field component along the line of sight. Polarized point sources in our data set have rotation measures that are comparable to the Faraday depths of the diffuse emission in our data. Our Faraday depth maps show narrow canals of low polarized intensity. We conclude that depolarization over the telescope beam produces at least some of these canals. Finally, we investigate the properties of one conspicuous region in this data set and argue that it is created by a decrease in line-of-sight depolarization compared to its surroundings.},

title = {Collective Processes in Relativistic Plasma and Their Implications for Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows},
abstract = {We consider the effects of collective plasma processes on synchrotron emission from highly relativistic electrons. We find, in agreement with the 1970 work of Sazonov, that strong effects are also possible in the absence of a nonrelativistic plasma component, due to the relativistic electrons (and protons) themselves. In contrast with Sazonov, who infers strong effects only in cases in which the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency is much larger than the square of the characteristic electron Lorentz factor, νp/νB>>γ2e, we also find strong effects for 1<<νp/νB <<γ2e. The modification of the spectrum is prominent at frequencies ν<=νR*≡ νpminγe, (νp/νB)1/2, where νR* generalizes the ``Razin-Tsytovich'' frequency νR≡γeνp to the regime νp/νB<<γ2e. Applying our results to gamma-ray burst (GRB) plasmas, we predict a strong modification of the radio spectrum on a minute timescale following the GRB at the onset of fireball interaction with its surrounding medium, in cases in which the ratio of the energy carried by the relativistic electrons to the energy carried by the magnetic field exceeds ~105. Plausible electron distribution functions may lead to negative synchrotron reabsorption, i.e., to coherent radio emission, which is characterized by a low degree of circular polarization. Detection of these effects would constrain the fraction of energy in the magnetic field, which is currently poorly determined by observations, and moreover would provide a novel handle on the properties of the environment into which the fireball expands.},

abstract = {The fluctuations in the emission of redshifted 21-cm photons from neutral intergalactic hydrogen will provide an unprecedented probe of the reionization era. Conventional wisdom assumes that this 21-cm signal disappears as soon as reionization is complete, when little atomic hydrogen is left through most of the volume of the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, observations of damped Lyα absorbers indicate that the fraction of hydrogen in its neutral form is significant by mass at all redshifts. Here we use a physically motivated model to show that residual neutral gas, confined to dense regions in the IGM with a high recombination rate, will generate a significant post-reionization 21-cm signal. We show that the power spectrum of fluctuations in this signal will be detectable by the first generation of low-frequency observatories at a signal-to-noise ratio that is comparable to that achievable in observations of the reionization era. The statistics of 21-cm fluctuations will therefore probe not only the pre-reionization IGM, but rather the entire process of HII region overlap, as well as the appearance of the diffuse ionized IGM.},

Using these approximations, we discuss how to maximize the scientific return of CMB mapping experiments given the practical constraints at hand, and our main conclusions are as follows. (1) For a given resolution and sensitivity, it is best to cover a sky area such that the signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element (pixel) is of order unity. (2) It is best to avoid excessively skinny observing regions, narrower than a few degrees. (3) The minimum-variance map-making method can reduce the effects of 1/f noise by a substantial factor, but only if the scan pattern is thoroughly interconnected. (4) 1/f noise produces a 1/l contribution to the angular power spectrum for well-connected single-beam scanning, as compared to virtually white noise for a two-beam scan pattern such as that of the MAP satellite.},

Our observations are among the first high-quality detections at such low frequencies. The measured pulse shapes are deconvolved for interstellar pulse broadening, yielding a pulse-broadening time of 670+/-100 μs, and the implied strength of scattering (scattering measure) is the lowest that is estimated toward the Crab Nebula from observations made so far. The sensitivity of the system is largely dictated by the sky background, and our simple equipment is capable of detecting pulses that are brighter than ~9 kJy in amplitude. The brightest giant pulse detected in our data has a peak amplitude of ~50 kJy, and the implied brightness temperature is 1031.6 K. We discuss the giant pulse detection prospects with the full MWA-LFD system. With a sensitivity over 2 orders of magnitude larger than the prototype equipment, the full system will be capable of detecting such bright giant pulses out to a wide range of Galactic distances; from ~15 to ~30 kpc depending on the frequency. The MWA-LFD will thus be a highly promising instrument for the studies of giant pulses and other fast radio transients at low frequencies.},

title = {The morphology of HII regions during reionization},
abstract = {It is possible that the properties of HII regions during reionization depend sensitively on many poorly constrained quantities [the nature of the ionizing sources, the clumpiness of the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM), the degree to which photoionizing feedback suppresses the abundance of low-mass galaxies, etc.], making it extremely difficult to interpret upcoming observations of this epoch. We demonstrate that the actual situation is more encouraging, using a suite of radiative transfer simulations, post-processed on outputs from a 10243, 94-Mpc N-body simulation. Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale structures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body simulation. We show that the morphology of the HII regions for reionization by POPII-like stars is most dependent on the global ionization fraction . Changing other parameters by an order of magnitude for fixed often results in similar bubble sizes and shapes. The next most important dependence is on the properties of the ionizing sources. The rarer the sources, the larger and more spherical the HII regions become. The typical bubble size can vary by as much as a factor of 4 at fixed between different possible source prescriptions. The final relevant factor is the abundance of minihaloes or of Lyman-limit systems. These systems suppress the largest bubbles from growing, and the magnitude of this suppression depends on the thermal history of the gas as well as the rate at which these systems are photo-evaporated. We find that neither source suppression owing to photo-heating nor small-scale gas clumping significantly affects the large-scale structure of the HII regions, with the ionization fraction power spectrum at fixed differing by less than 20 per cent for k < 5Mpc-1 between all the source suppression and clumping models we consider. Analytic models of reionization are successful at predicting many of the features seen in our simulations. We discuss how observations of the 21-cm line with the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) can constrain properties of reionization, and we study the effect patchy reionization has on the statistics of Lyα emitting galaxies.},

title = {Have We Detected Patchy Reionization in Quasar Spectra?},
abstract = {The Lyα forest at z>~5.5 shows strong scatter in the mean transmission even when smoothed over extremely large spatial scales, >~50 Mpc h-1. This has been interpreted as a signature of strongly fluctuating radiation fields or patchy reionization. To test this claim, we calculate the scatter arising solely from density fluctuations, assuming a uniform ionizing background, via analytic arguments and simulations. This scatter alone is comparable to that observed. It rises steeply with redshift and is of order unity by z~6, even on ~50 Mpc h-1 scales. This arises because (1) at z~6, transmission spectra, which are sensitive mainly to rare voids, are highly biased (with a linear bias factor b>=4) tracers of underlying density fluctuations and (2) small-scale transverse modes are aliased to long-wavelength line-of-sight modes. Inferring patchy reionization from quasar spectra is therefore subtle and requires much more detailed modeling. Similarly, we expect density fluctuations alone to produce order unity transmission fluctuations in the z~3 He II Lyα forest on the scales over which these measurements are typically made.},

abstract = {Weak-lensing surveys have become a powerful tool for mapping mass distributions and constraining the expansion history of our universe, but continuum surveys must average over a large number of galaxies to average down the ellipticity noise due to the unknown ellipticity and orientation of the lensed galaxies.

By studying the inherent noise characteristics, we argue this new technique could rival or exceed the sensitivity of traditional continuum observations for upcoming H I radio surveys.},

title = {Probing the Neutral Fraction of the IGM with GRBs during the Epoch of Reionization},
abstract = {We show that near-infrared observations of the red side of the Ly-alpha line from a single gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow cannot be used to constrain the global neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), x_H, at the GRB's redshift to better than ~0.3. Some GRB sight-lines will encounter more neutral hydrogen than others at fixed x_H owing to the patchiness of reionisation. GRBs during the epoch of reionization will often bear no discernible signature of a neutral IGM in their afterglow spectra. We discuss the constraints on x_H from the z = 6.3 burst, GRB050904, and quantify the probability of detecting a neutral IGM using future spectroscopic observations of high-redshift, near-infrared GRB afterglows. Assuming an observation with signal-to-noise similar to the Subaru FOCAS spectrum of GRB050904 and that the column density distribution of damped Ly-alpha absorbers is the same as measured at lower redshifts, a GRB from an epoch when x_H = 0.5 can be used to detect a partly neutral IGM at 98% confidence level 10% of the time (and, for an observation with three times the sensitivity, 30% of the time).},

title = {The Cross-Correlation of High-Redshift 21 cm and Galaxy Surveys},
abstract = {We study the detectability of the cross-correlation between 21 cm emission from the intergalactic medium and the galaxy distribution during (and before) reionization. We show that first-generation 21 cm experiments, such as the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA), can measure the cross-correlation to a precision of several percent on scales k~0.1 Mpc-1 if combined with a deep galaxy survey detecting all galaxies with m>1010 Msolar over the entire ~800 deg2 field of view of the MWA. LOFAR can attain even better limits with galaxy surveys covering its ~50 deg2 field of view. The errors on the cross power spectrum scale with the square root of the overlap volume, so even reasonably modest surveys of several square degrees should yield a positive detection with either instrument. In addition to the obvious scientific value, the cross-correlation has four key advantages over the 21 cm signal alone: (1) its signal-to-noise ratio exceeds that of the 21 cm power spectrum by a factor of several, allowing it to probe smaller spatial scales and perhaps to detect inhomogeneous reionization more efficiently; (2) it allows a cleaner division of the redshift-space distortions (although only if the galaxy redshifts are known precisely); (3) by correlating with the high-redshift galaxy population, the cosmological nature of the 21 cm fluctuations can be determined unambiguously; and (4) the required level of foreground cleaning for the 21 cm signal is vastly reduced.},

title = {21 cm Tomography with Foregrounds},
abstract = {Twenty-one centimeter tomography is emerging as a powerful tool to explore the reionization epoch and cosmological parameters, but it will only be as good as our ability to accurately model and remove astrophysical foreground contamination. Previous treatments of this problem have focused on the angular structure of the signal and foregrounds and what can be achieved with limited spectral resolution (channel widths in the 1 MHz range). In this paper we introduce and evaluate a ``blind'' method to extract the multifrequency 21 cm signal by taking advantage of the smooth frequency structure of the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We find that 21 cm tomography is typically limited by foregrounds on scales of k<<1 h Mpc-1 and is limited by noise on scales of k>>1 h Mpc-1, provided that the experimental channel width can be made substantially smaller than 0.1 MHz. Our results show that this approach is quite promising even for scenarios with rather extreme contamination from point sources and diffuse Galactic emission, which bodes well for upcoming experiments such as LOFAR, MWA, PAST, and SKA.},

abstract = {A new generation of radio telescopes is achieving unprecedented levels of sensitivity and resolution, as well as increased agility and field-of-view, by employing high-performance digital signal processing hardware to phase and correlate large numbers of antennas. The computational demands of these imaging systems scale in proportion to BMN^2, where B is the signal bandwidth, M is the number of independent beams, and N is the number of antennas. The specifications of many new arrays lead to demands in excess of tens of PetaOps per second. To meet this challenge, we have developed a general purpose correlator architecture using standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal processing libraries we have developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal processing systems, with correlators foremost among them,and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. We present several correlator deployments, including a 16-antenna, 200-MHz bandwidth, 4-bit, full Stokes parameter application deployed on the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization.},

title = {Efficient Simulations of Early Structure Formation and Reionization},
abstract = {Detailed theoretical studies of the high-redshift universe, and especially reionization, are generally forced to rely on time-consuming N-body codes and/or radiative transfer algorithms. We present a method to construct seminumerical ``simulations,'' which can efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor, because ionized regions reach scales of tens of comoving Mpc. We test our halo-finding and ionization-mapping algorithms separately against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean hydrogen neutral fraction, x¯HI, especially early in reionization. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, although these effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M>=2.2×108 Msolar. We show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization, x¯HI<~0.5, requires such large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our seminumerical approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation and reionization.},

title = {Ionospheric calibration of low frequency radio interferometric observations using the peeling scheme. I. Method description and first results},
abstract = {Calibration of radio interferometric observations becomes increasingly difficult towards lower frequencies. Below ˜ 300 MHz, spatially variant refractions and propagation delays of radio waves traveling through the ionosphere cause phase rotations that can vary significantly with time, viewing direction and antenna location. In this article we present a description and first results of SPAM (Source Peeling and Atmospheric Modeling), a new calibration method that attempts to iteratively solve and correct for ionospheric phase errors. To model the ionosphere, we construct a time-variant, 2-dimensional phase screen at fixed height above the Earth's surface. Spatial variations are described by a truncated set of discrete Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve base functions, optimized for an assumed power-law spectral density of free electrons density fluctuations, and a given configuration of calibrator sources and antenna locations. The model is constrained using antenna-based gain phases from individual self-calibrations on the available bright sources in the field-of-view. Application of SPAM on three test cases, a simulated visibility data set and two selected 74 MHz VLA data sets, yields significant improvements in image background noise (5-75 percent reduction) and source peak fluxes (up to 25 percent increase) as compared to the existing self-calibration and field-based calibration methods, which indicates a significant improvement in ionospheric phase calibration accuracy.},

title = {Improving Foreground Subtraction in Statistical Observations of 21 cm Emission from the Epoch of Reionization},
abstract = {Statistical observations of the epoch of reionization using the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of structure formation and the first luminous objects. However, these observations are complicated by a host of strong foreground sources. Several foreground-removal techniques have been proposed in the literature, and it has been assumed that these would be used in combination to reveal the epoch of reionization (EOR) signal. By studying the characteristic subtraction errors of the proposed foreground-removal techniques, we identify an additional subtraction stage that can further reduce the EOR foreground contamination, and study the interactions between the foreground-removal algorithms. This enables us to outline a comprehensive foreground-removal strategy that incorporates all previously proposed subtraction techniques. Using this foreground-removal framework and the characteristic subtraction errors, we discuss the complementarity of different foreground-removal techniques and the implications for array design and the analysis of EOR data.},

title = {Imprint of Inhomogeneous Reionization on the Power Spectrum of Galaxy Surveys at High Redshifts},
abstract = {We consider the effects of inhomogeneous reionization on the distribution of galaxies at high redshifts. Modulation of the formation process of the ionizing sources by large-scale density modes makes reionization inhomogeneous and introduces a spread to the reionization times of different regions with the same size. After sources photoionize and heat these regions to a temperature >~104 K at different times, their temperatures evolve as the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) expands. The varying IGM temperature makes the minimum mass of galaxies spatially nonuniform with a fluctuation amplitude that increases toward small scales. These scale-dependent fluctuations modify the shape of the power spectrum of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way that depends on the history of reionization. The resulting distortion of the primordial power spectrum is significantly larger than changes associated with uncertainties in the inflationary parameters, such as the spectral index of the scalar power spectrum or the running of the spectral index. Future surveys of high-redshift galaxies will offer a new probe of the thermal history of the IGM but might have a more limited scope in constraining inflation.},

title = {Power Spectrum Sensitivity and the Design of Epoch of Reionization Observatories},
abstract = {Recent theoretical developments for observing the epoch of reionization (EOR) have concentrated on the power spectrum signature of redshifted 21 cm emission. These studies have demonstrated the great potential of statistical EOR observations; however, the sensitivity calculations for proposed low-frequency radio arrays have been highly approximate. The formalism developed for interferometric measurements of the cosmic microwave background can be extended to three dimensions to naturally incorporate the line-of-sight information inherent in the EOR signal. In this paper we demonstrate how to accurately calculate the EOR power spectrum sensitivity of an array and develop scaling relationships that can be used to guide the design of EOR observatories. The implications for antenna distribution, antenna size, and correlator requirements on the EOR sensitivity are detailed.},

Direct images were obtained by a digital lens (a 2D spatial fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor), which transforms complex amplitudes in 2D space (the electric-fields over the array antennas) to those in momentum space (k space). Using a newly developed phase-measuring technique, the instrumental phase errors were corrected before the observation. As a result, the first direct 2D images were obtained with the radio interferometer. 'Direct' means the capability to image non-ergodic (time average not equal to ensemble average) sources, such as pulsars or communication signals, of which Fourier-synthesis telescopes could not make images.},

One of the major outstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by numerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of H II regions during the reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large-scale density fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of ionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from the H II regions that should be observable with the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions beyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively changes the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.},

title = {Probing the Epoch of Reionization with Power Spectrum Measurements by the First Generation of Low Frequency Radio Arrays},
abstract = {The reionization history of the universe provides an important tool for understanding structure formation and the appearance of the first luminous objects. Existing experimental clues about the epoch of reionization (EOR) are confusing, however, and directly observing the process of structure formation would yield significant insights. Neutral hydrogen emission from this period due to the redshifted 21 cm line should appear very faintly at low radio frequencies between 75 -> 200 MHz (for redshifts 18 -> 6). As the primordial hydrogen in the intergalactic medium cools and later reheats, density contrasts are revealed as fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the emission, and as the first luminous objects ionize their surroundings, bubbles appear. Measuring the redshifted 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum and its evolution would provide a wealth of information about structure formation and the fundamental astrophysics of reionization. At high redshift, observations would explore structure formation in the linear gravity regime and constrain the properties of dark matter, and at lower redshifts, they would probe reionization and follow the emergence and properties of the first luminous objects. The initial detection of redshited 21 cm emission from the EOR is anticipated to be a challenging experimental undertaking. The first generation of radio observatories targeting the full EOR power spectrum consists of three instruments that are currently under development: MWA, PAST, and LOFAR. We present the results of calculations of the sensitivity of first generation EOR observatories using realistic design parameters such as antenna layout, field of view, and antenna temperature. We conclude that statistical observations of the EOR power spectrum should be obtainable below redshift 10 presuming foreground contamination can be mitigated. We also provide a fiducial mark for the capabilities of these observations to discern reionization scenarios and cosmological models.},

title = {LOFAR as a probe of the sources of cosmological reionization},
abstract = {We propose use of the thickness of the ionization front as a discriminant between alternative modes of reionization in the early Universe, by stars or by miniquasars. Assuming a photoionization-recombination balance, we find that for miniquasar sources the transition from neutral to ionized intergalactic medium is extended and has two features. The first is a sudden steep increase in the neutral fraction with a typical width of 5-10 comoving megaparsecs, depending on the miniquasar power. The second feature is a long wing that represents a much slower transition from a neutral fraction of ~ 0.8 to 1. The angular resolution of LOFAR is expected to resolve these scales and will, therefore, play an important role in discriminating the hard sources of ionizing photons from the stellar ones.},

title = {Cosmological Parameter Estimation Using 21 cm Radiation from the Epoch of Reionization},
abstract = {A number of radio interferometers are currently being planned or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on Ωw, Ωmh2, Ωbh2, Ων, ns, and αs. If the universe is substantially ionized by z~12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.},

abstract = {Non-coplanar sampling of the coherence function of distant radio sources measured by interferometric arrays leads to errors in the imaging of wide fields when standard two-dimensional techniques are employed. Unlike co-planar sampling, the relationship between sky brightness and the coherence is not a simple two-dimensional Fourier transform, so the standard methods of image reconstruction cannot be utilized. We have developed and tested two methods of correctly imaging data taken from non-coplanar arrays: (1) A method based on Clark's observation that there exists a three-dimensional Fourier transform relationship between the sampled data and a three-dimensional image 'volume' within which the two-dimensional sky brightness is located; and (2) A multiple-field imaging technique which approximates the full three-dimensional relation as a patchwork of subfields. This method has been extended to allow each patch to be three dimensional. We demonstrate these two methods using 327 MHz data from the l-km maximum baseline and 10-km maximum baseline configurations of the VLA.},

title = {How to measure CMB power spectra without losing information},
abstract = {A new method for estimating the angular power spectrum Cl from cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps is presented, which has the following desirable properties. (1) It is unbeatable in the sense that no other method can measure Cl with smaller error bars. (2) It is quadratic, which makes the statistical properties of the measurements easy to compute and use for estimation of cosmological parameters. (3) It is computationally faster than rival high-precision methods such as the nonlinear maximum-likelihood technique, with the crucial steps scaling as n2 rather than n3, where n is the number of map pixels. (4) It is applicable to any survey geometry whatsoever, with arbitrary regions masked out and arbitrary noise behavior. (5) It is not a ``black-box'' method, but quite simple to understand intuitively: it corresponds to a high-pass filtering and edge softening of the original map followed by a straight expansion in truncated spherical harmonics. It is argued that this method is computationally feasible even for future high-resolution CMB experiments with n~106-107. It is shown that Cl computed with this method is useful not merely for graphical presentation purposes, but also as an intermediate (and arguably necessary) step in the data analysis pipeline, reducing the data set to a more manageable size before the final step of constraining Gaussian cosmological models and parameters - while retaining all the cosmological information that was present in the original map.},

title = {Redshifted 21cm Observations of High Redshift Quasar Proximity Zones},
abstract = {The introduction of low-frequency radio arrays is expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of the contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large HII region and the surrounding neutral inter-galactic medium (IGM) will be the simplest and most easily interpreted signature. However the highest redshift quasars known are thought to reside in an ionized IGM. Using a semi-analytic model we describe the redshifted 21cm signal from the IGM surrounding quasars discovered using the i-drop out technique (i.e. quasars at z~6). We argue that while quasars at z<6.5 seem to reside in the post overlap IGM, they will still provide valuable probes of the late stages of the overlap era because the light-travel time across a quasar proximity zone should be comparable to the duration of overlap. For redshifted 21cm observations within a 32MHz bandpass, we find that the subtraction of a spectrally smooth foreground will not remove spectral features due to the proximity zone. These features could be used to measure the neutral hydrogen content of the IGM during the late stages of reionization. The density of quasars at z~6 is now well constrained. We use the measured quasar luminosity function to estimate the prospects for discovery of high redshift quasars in fields that will be observed by the Murchison Widefield Array.},

title = {The GRB All-sky Spectrometer Experiment (GASE)},

Prompt coherent low frequency radio emission would provide a unique probe of the plasma conditions near the blast wave during the period of peak particle acceleration and gamma ray emission. In this paper we introduce the GRB All-sky Spectrometer Experiment (GASE). This experiment will make use of advances in digital technology to record 4 MHz of bandwidth in eight 30 MHz dipole antennas for two hours after a Swift or HETE-2 trigger is received. Due to the long dispersion delay at low frequencies, this allows contemporaneous measurements of the gamma ray and radio emission. The high spectral resolution of GASE will allow the predicted prompt 30 MHz signal from GRBs to be fully de-dispersed and identified. The combination of high spectral resolution, full-sky imaging, and (if required) geographically separated detectors will also provide stringent rejection of radio interference.},

title = {The effects of reionization on Lyα galaxy surveys},
abstract = {Searches for Lyα emission lines are among the most effective ways to identify high-redshift galaxies. They are particularly interesting because they probe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the intergalactic medium: nearby neutral gas efficiently absorbs Lyα photons. The observed linestrengths depend on the amount by which each photon is able to redshift away from line centre before encountering neutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the sources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the effects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyα emitters and their observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of high-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those expected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyα-emitting galaxies remain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline by only a factor of ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to (or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across the sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which become increasingly rare as decreases. Thus, the size distribution also affects the apparent clustering of Lyα-selected galaxies. On large scales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased than the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as decreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a survey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours. The transition between these two regimes occurs at the characteristic bubble size. Hence, large Lyα galaxy surveys have the potential to measure directly the size distribution of HII regions during reionization.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen probe the epoch of reionization. We examine the observability of this signal and the impact of extragalactic foreground radio sources (both extended and point-like). We use cosmological simulations to predict the angular correlation functions of intensity fluctuations due to unresolved radio galaxies, cluster radio haloes and relics and free-free emission from the interstellar and intergalactic medium at the frequencies and angular scales relevant for the proposed 21-cm tomography. In accord with previous findings, the brightness temperature fluctuations due to foreground sources are much larger than those from the primary 21-cm signal at all scales. In particular, diffuse cluster radio emission, which has been previously neglected, provides the most significant foreground contamination. However, we show that the contribution to the angular fluctuations at scales θ>~ 1 arcmin is dominated by the spatial clustering of bright foreground sources. This excess can be removed if sources above flux levels S>~ 0.1 mJy (out to redshifts of z~ 1 and z~ 2 for diffuse and point sources, respectively) are detected and removed. Hence, efficient source removal may be sufficient to allow the detection of angular fluctuations in the 21-cm emission free of extragalactic foregrounds at θ>~ 1 arcmin. In addition, the removal of sources above S= 0.1 mJy also reduces the foreground fluctuations to roughly the same level as the 21-cm signal at scales θ<~ 1 arcmin. This should allow the substraction of the foreground components in frequency space, making it possible to observe in detail the topology and history of reionization.},

title = {Constraints on Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts},
abstract = {The Milagro Gamma-Ray Observatory employs a water Cerenkov detector to observe extensive air showers produced by high-energy particles interacting in the Earth's atmosphere. Milagro has a wide field of view and high duty cycle, monitoring the northern sky almost continuously in the 100 GeV to 100 TeV energy range. Milagro is thus uniquely capable of searching for very high energy emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) during the prompt emission phase. Detection of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on GRB mechanisms. Twenty-five satellite-triggered GRBs occurred within the field of view of Milagro between 2000 January and 2001 December. We have searched for counterparts to these GRBs and found no significant emission from any of the burst positions. Due to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic background light, detections are only expected to be possible for redshifts less than ~0.5. Three of the GRBs studied have measured redshifts. GRB 010921 has a redshift low enough (0.45) to allow an upper limit on the fluence to place an observational constraint on potential GRB models.},

abstract = {In radio astronomy, mosaicing is the practice of combining multiple pointings of a telescope to produce an image significantly larger than the telescope's primary beam. We consider an approach to imaging and deconvolving interferometric mosaic observations. This approach directly deconvolves a linear mosaic of dirty images. We consider the advantages and limitations of this technique. Projection issues for mosaicing are also discussed. We present an example from a 320-pointing, spectral-line, mosaiced observation of the Small Magellanic Cloud.},

title = {Foregrounds for redshifted 21-cm studies of reionization: Giant Meter Wave Radio Telescope 153-MHz observations},
abstract = {Foreground subtraction is the biggest challenge for future redshifted 21-cm observations to probe reionization. We use a short Giant Meter Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observation at 153MHz to characterize the statistical properties of the background radiation across ~1$\,^{\circ}$ to subarcmin angular scales, and across a frequency band of 5MHz with 62.5kHz resolution. The statistic we use is the visibility correlation function, or equivalently the angular power spectrum Cl. We present the results obtained from using relatively unsophisticated, conventional data calibration procedures. We find that even fairly simple-minded calibration allows one to estimate the visibility correlation function at a given frequency V2(U, 0). From our observations, we find that V2(U, 0) is consistent with foreground model predictions at all angular scales except the largest ones probed by our observations where the model predictions are somewhat in excess. On the other hand, the visibility correlation between different frequencies κ(U, Δν) seems to be much more sensitive to calibration errors. We find a rapid decline in κ(U, Δν), in contrast with the prediction of less than 1 per cent variation across 2.5MHz. In this case, however, it seems likely that a substantial part of the discrepancy may be due to limitations of data reduction procedures.},

title = {How to Make Maps from Cosmic Microwave Background Data without Losing Information},
abstract = {The next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments can measure cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy---in principle. To achieve this in practice when faced with such gigantic data sets, elaborate data analysis methods are needed to make it computationally feasible. An important step in the data pipeline is to make a map, which typically reduces the size of the data set by orders of magnitude. We compare 10 map-making methods and find that for the Gaussian case, both the method used by the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) team and various forms of Wiener filtering are optimal in the sense that the map retains all cosmological information that was present in the time-ordered data (TOD). Specifically, one obtains just as small error bars on cosmological parameters when estimating them from the map as one could have obtained by estimating them directly from the TOD. The method of simply averaging the observations of each pixel (for total-power detectors), on the contrary, is found generally to destroy information, as does the maximum entropy method and most other nonlinear map-making techniques. Since it is also numerically feasible, the COBE method is the natural choice for large data sets. Other lossless (e.g., Wiener-filtered) maps can then be computed directly from the COBE method map.},

The neutral hydrogen imprinted acoustic oscillations on the pattern of brightness fluctuations due to its redshifted 21-cm absorption of the CMB. Unlike CMB temperature fluctuations which probe the power spectrum at cosmic recombination, we show that observations of the 21-cm fluctuations at z~ 20-200 can measure four separate fluctuation modes (with a fifth mode requiring very high precision), thus providing a unique probe of the geometry and composition of the universe.},
